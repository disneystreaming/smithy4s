Restrictions and Validation​ Using the adt trait does come with some restrictions. First are requirements for the union which is annotated with the adt trait: The union must contain at least one memberThe union's members must only target structure shapes Additionally, there is a requirement that is added onto the structure shapes that the union targets: The structures must NOT be the target of any other union, structure, etc. They can only be the target in the ONE union that is annotated with the adt trait. A validator will be run automatically on your model to make sure it conforms to the requirements above. Note: The adt trait has NO impact on the serialization/deserialization behaviors of Smithy4s. The only thing it changes is what the generated code looks like. This is accomplished by keeping the rendered schemas equivalent, even if the case class is rendered in a different place. Mixins​ The adt trait has some extra functionality in place to improve ergonomics when working with the generated code. Specifically, the smithy4s code generation will extract all common mixins from the structure members the union targets and move them to the level of the sealed trait that represents the adt. This is easier to conceptualize with an example: @adt union OrderType { inStore: InStoreOrder online: OnlineOrder } @mixin structure HasId { @required id: String } @mixin structure HasLocation { @required locationId: String } structure InStoreOrder with [HasId, HasLocation] { description: String } structure OnlineOrder with [HasId] { @required userId: String }  This Smithy model will lead to the following generated code: HasId.scala: trait HasId { def id: String }  HasLocation.scala: trait HasLocation { def locationId: String }  sealed trait OrderType extends HasId scala.Product with scala.Serializable case class InStoreOrder(id: String, locationId: String) extends OrderType with HasLocation case class OnlineOrder(id: String, userId: String) extends OrderType  Since both OnlineOrder and InStoreOrder use the HasId mixin, that mixin is moved to the OrderType level in the generated code. This allows for more flexibility when working with adts. Since only InStoreOrder uses the HasLocation mixin, that mixin is kept at the level of InStoreOrder and extended directly by that case class.

Given a custom email type such as: // Note, we recommend using a newtype library over a regular case class in most cases // But this is shown to simplify the example case class Email(value: String) object Email { private def isValidEmail(value: String): Boolean = ??? def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] = if (isValidEmail(value)) Right(new Email(value)) else Left(&quot;Email is not valid&quot;) } Next, we will need to provide a way for smithy4s to understand how to construct and deconstruct our Email type. We do this by defining an instance of a RefinementProvider. Note that the RefinementProvider we create MUST be implicit. // package myapp.types import smithy4s._ case class Email(value: String) object Email { private def isValidEmail(value: String): Boolean = ??? def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] = if (isValidEmail(value)) Right(new Email(value)) else Left(&quot;Email is not valid&quot;) implicit val provider = Refinement.drivenBy[EmailFormat]( Email.apply, // Tells smithy4s how to create an Email (or get an error message) given a string (e: Email) =&gt; e.value // Tells smithy4s how to get a string from an Email ) } info The EmailFormat type passed as a type parameter to Refinement.drivenBy is the type that smithy4s generated from our @emailFormat trait we defined in our smithy file earlier. Now, we just have one thing left to do: tell smithy4s where to find our custom Email type. We do this using a trait called smithy4s.meta#refinement. use smithy4s.meta#refinement apply test#emailFormat @refinement( targetType: &quot;myapp.types.Email&quot; ) Here we are applying the refinement trait to our emailFormat trait we defined earlier. We are providing the targetType which is our Email case class we defined. Smithy4s will now be able to update how it does code generation to reference our custom Email type. info If the provider was not in the companion object of our targetType, we would need to provide the providerImport to the refinement trait so that smithy4s would be able to find it. For example: use smithy4s.meta#refinement apply test#emailFormat @refinement( targetType: &quot;myapp.types.Email&quot;, providerImport: &quot;myapp.types.providers._&quot; ) Whether the provider is in the companion object or not, it must be implicit. Parameterised Types​ As of smithy4s version 0.17, you can now create refinements on types that take a generic type parameter. This can be accomplished by setting parameterised to true as seen below. @trait(selector: &quot;list&quot;) @refinement( targetType: &quot;smithy4s.example.refined.NonEmptyList&quot;, parameterised: true ) structure nonEmptyListFormat {} Following this, we now need to create our refinement provider as we did with the example above. In this case, we will use an implicit function so we can reference the generic type parameter A. This allows us to use the same implementation of NonEmptyList across lists containing any type. import smithy4s._ case class NonEmptyList[A] private (values: List[A]) object NonEmptyList { def apply[A](values: List[A]): Either[String, NonEmptyList[A]] = if (values.size &gt; 0) Right(new NonEmptyList(values)) else Left(&quot;List must not be empty.&quot;) implicit def provider[A] = Refinement.drivenBy[NonEmptyListFormat]( NonEmptyList.apply[A], (b: NonEmptyList[A]) =&gt; b.values ) } Now we can apply our nonEmptyListFormat trait as follows: @nonEmptyListFormat list NonEmptyStrings { member: String } In the generated Scala code, this will render as a NonEmptyList[String] instead of a List[String].

Rather, the Smithy models dictates the encoding. Indeed, there are multiple ways to encode unions in JSON. By default, the specification of the Smithy language hints that the tagged-union encoding should be used. This is arguably the best encoding for unions, as it works with members of any type (not just structures), and does not require backtracking during parsing, which makes it more efficient. However, Smithy4s provides support for two additional encodings: discriminated and untagged, which users can opt-in via the alloy#discriminated and alloy#untagged trait, respectively. These are mostly offered as a way to retrofit existing APIs in Smithy. Tagged union​ This is the default behaviour, and happens to visually match how Smithy unions are declared. In this encoding, the union is encoded as a JSON object with a single key-value pair, the key signalling which alternative has been encoded. union Tagged { first: String second: IntWrapper } structure IntWrapper { int: Integer }  The following instances of Tagged Tagged.FirstCase(&quot;smithy4s&quot;) Tagged.SecondCase(IntWrapper(42)))  are encoded as such : { &quot;first&quot;: &quot;smithy4s&quot; } { &quot;second&quot;: { &quot;int&quot;: 42 } }  Untagged union​ Untagged unions are supported via an annotation: @untagged. Despite the smaller payload size this encoding produces, it is arguably the worst way of encoding unions, as it may require backtracking multiple times on the parsing side. Use this carefully, preferably only when you need to retrofit an existing API into Smithy use alloy#untagged @untagged union Untagged { first: String second: IntWrapper } structure IntWrapper { int: Integer }  The following instances of Untagged Untagged.FirstCase(&quot;smithy4s&quot;) Untagged.SecondCase(Two(42)))  are encoded as such : &quot;smithy4s&quot; { &quot;int&quot;: 42 }  Discriminated union​ Discriminated union are supported via an annotation: @discriminated(&quot;tpe&quot;), and work only when all members of the union are structures. In this encoding, the discriminator is inlined as a JSON field within JSON object resulting from the encoding of the member. Despite the JSON payload exhibiting less nesting than in the tagged union encoding, this encoding often leads to bigger payloads, and requires backtracking once during parsing. use alloy#discriminated @discriminated(&quot;tpe&quot;) union Discriminated { first: StringWrapper second: IntWrapper } structure StringWrapper { string: String } structure IntWrapper { int: Integer }  The following instances of Discriminated Discriminated.FirstCase(StringWrapper(&quot;smithy4s&quot;)) Discriminated.SecondCase(IntWrapper(42)))  are encoded as such { &quot;tpe&quot;: &quot;first&quot;, &quot;string&quot;: &quot;smithy4s&quot; } { &quot;tpe&quot;: &quot;second&quot;, &quot;int&quot;: 42 }  "},{"title":"Datatypes and schemas","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/schemas","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"The Schema GADT​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Datatypes and schemas","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/schemas#the-schema-gadt","content":"Each datatype generated by Smithy4s is accompanied by a schema value in its companion object, which contains an expression of type smithy4s.schema.Schema that captures everything needed to deconstruct/reconstruct instances of the datatype. smithy4s.schema.Schema is a Generalised Algebraic Datatype (or GADT for short) that can be used to precisely reference all the information needed to traverse datatypes that can be expressed in Smithy. It is a bit like JVM reflection, except that it exposes higher-level information about the datatypes. It achieves this by exposing building blocks that accurately reflect what is possible to express in the Smithy language. These building blocks form a metamodel: a model for models. And, unlike JVM reflection, using schemas is type-safe. The Schema type reflects the various ways of constructing datatypes in Smithy. It is encoded as a sealed trait, the members of which capture the following aspects of the Smithy language: PrimitivesListsSetsMapsEnumerationsStructuresUnions For a Scala type called Foo, formulating a Schema[Foo] is equivalent to exhaustively capturing the information needed for the serialisation and deserialisation of Foo in any format (JSON, XML, ...). Indeed, for any Codec[_] construct provided by third-party libraries, it is possible to write a generic def compile(schema: Schema[A]): Codec[A] function that produces the Codec for A based on the information held by the Schema. Why do things this way? Why not just render Codec during code generation? The reason is that we want for the generated code to be completely decoupled from any serialisation format or library, and for the user to have the ability to wire that generated code in different ways, without having to change anything in the build. Moreover, this approach has proven that it allows for a bounded investment for adding interop with various libraries, and offers really good testability.

Smithy4s generically translates these annotations to instances of the corresponding generated classes, which means that Smithy4s supports generating user defined traits that it has zero knowledge of. So if you have the following Smithy description: namespace example @trait structure metadata { @required description: String } @metadata(description: &quot;This is my own integer shape&quot;) integer MyInt  When processing this Smithy model, Smithy4s renders a case class Metadata(description: String), with an assocaited ShapeTag[Metadata] instance, and the following expression in the companion object of MyInt: val hints = Hints( Metadata(&quot;this is my own integer shape&quot;) )  The smithy4s.Hints type is a polymorphic map that can hold shapes, keyed by ShapeTag. A ShapeTag is a uniquely identified tag that uses referential equality. Every schema can hold a Hints instance, which means that in addition to the datatype structures, Schemas also offer an accurate reflection of the trait values that annotate shapes in the smithy models. Smithy4s uses these hints to implement interpreters. For instance, the smithy.api#jsonName smithy trait translates to a smithy.api.JsonName Scala type, that we can query from a Hints instance when implementing a Schema ~&gt; JsonCodec transformation. This allows to give users a little customisability in the json serialisation of their datatypes. "},{"title":"Structures​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Datatypes and schemas","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/schemas#structures","content":"A structure, also referred to as product, or record, is a construct that groups several values together.

Every member of the structure that does not have the @required trait is rendered as an optional value defaulting to None (by default, smithy4s sorts the fields before rendering the case class so that the required ones appear before the optional ones. That is a pragmatic decision that tends to improve UX for users.) Indeed, for each field, there is an associated reference to a schema (int, string, ...), a string label, and a lambda calling the case class accessor that allows the retrieval of the associated field value. Additionally, the constructor of the case class is also referenced in the Schema. Typically, the accessors are needed for encoding the data, which involves destructuring it to access its individual components. The labels are there to cater to serialisation mechanisms like JSON or XML, where sub-components of a piece of data are labelled and nested under a larger block. Conversely, the constructor is used for deserialisation, which involves reconstructing the data after all of its component values have been successfully deserialised. Another detail is the presence of the addHints call on field labelled with b. This is due to the presence of the length trait (from the smithy.api namespace, aka the prelude) on the corresponding b member of the smithy Foo shape. Note related to optional and required​ You may have noticed the required and optional methods, which create Field instances from Schemas, in order to pass them to structures. In Smithy4s, the concept of Option only exists relatively to struct calls. It is not possible to construct a Schema[Option[A]] on its own. The rationale is that having a first class Option schema constructor leads to leaks in the implementation of serialisation mechanisms, as None typically represents the absence of value, and allowing for serialising an absence of value in formats that typically do not support it implies the leak of Option (or equivalent) in various interfaces. Additionally, a first class Option schema constructor would allow to create schemas for Option[Option[Option[Int]]], and even though we recognise that there are some things that could be encoded this way, it is just not a very pragmatic possibility, and opens the door for easy violation of round-trip properties that any serialisation technology should respect. For instance: Some(None) and None can easily have the same encoding in Json, so how do you distinguish between the two during decoding?

It is the dual of a structure: when structures express that you have A AND B, unions express that you can have A OR B. The way this is expressed in Smithy looks like this: namespace example union Bar { a: Integer b: String }  This hints at the default serialisation that AWS has intended to use on unions expressed in smithy, namely tagged unions. Indeed, the AWS json-centric protocols specifies that shapes like these should be serialised in objects with a single key/value entry, where the key receives the value of the tag. For instance, { &quot;a&quot;: 1 } or { &quot;b&quot;: &quot;two&quot; }. There are some very relevant technical reasons for it, but this way of encoding unions/co-products in JSON is arguably the best. It may also be familiar to Circe users as it's the default encoding of co-products in circe-generic. Regarding the Scala code rendered by Smithy4s for the above Smithy specification, it looks like this: package example import smithy4s.schema.Schema._ sealed trait Bar extends scala.Product with scala.Serializable object Bar extends smithy4s.ShapeTag.Companion[Bar] { val id: smithy4s.ShapeId = smithy4s.ShapeId(&quot;foobar&quot;, &quot;Bar&quot;) case class ACase(a: Int) extends Bar case class BCase(b: String) extends Bar object ACase { val hints: smithy4s.Hints = smithy4s.Hints.empty val schema: smithy4s.Schema[ACase] = bijection(int.addHints(hints), ACase(_), _.a) val alt = schema.oneOf[Bar](&quot;a&quot;) } object BCase { val hints: smithy4s.Hints = smithy4s.Hints.empty val schema: smithy4s.Schema[BCase] = bijection(string.addHints(hints), BCase(_), _.b) val alt = schema.oneOf[Bar](&quot;b&quot;) } implicit val schema: smithy4s.Schema[Bar] = union( ACase.alt, BCase.alt, ){ case c: ACase =&gt; ACase.alt(c) case c: BCase =&gt; BCase.alt(c) }.withId(id) }  The union is rendered as an ADT (sealed trait), the members of which are single-value case classes wrapping values of the types referenced by the union member. The Case suffix is added as a way to reduce risk of collision between the generated code and other types (especially the types being wrapped). Each ADT member is accompanied by its own schema, which is not provided implicitly, in an effort to retain coherence in the type-class instances, and avoid the situation where you'd have different behaviours during serialisation based on whether you've up-casted a member to the ADT. Additionally, the companion objects of each ADT members contain an alt value (for &quot;alternative&quot;), which is the union's equivalent to the structure's field. Much like a field, an alt contains a label, and can carry hints. But unlike a field, which contains an accessor, the alt contains the function to &quot;inject&quot; (up-cast) the member into the union. This is useful for de-serialisation, when, after successfully de-serialising a member of a union, you need to inject it into the ADT to return the expected type. As for the union's schema, it is somewhat similar to the structure's, in that it references all its alternatives. But instead of a structure's constructor, we have a dispatch function instead, which contains a pattern match against all the possible members, and dispatches the &quot;down-casted&quot; value to its corresponding alternative. This is useful for serialisation, when the behaviour of the alternatives can only be applied to values of the corresponding type: &quot;if my ADT is an A, then I serialise the A, and add a discriminating tag to the serialised A&quot;.

Additionally to the GADT members stated previously, Schema also has a BijectionSchema member, which allows to apply bidirectional transformation on other Schemas.

Smithy does not support generics, therefore all collection are named. Though seemingly tedious, it makes it easier to build tooling (and probably helps languages that do not support generics). Provided the following shape : namespace example list IntList { member: Integer }  You get the following Scala code : package example object IntList extends Newtype[List[Int]] { val id: smithy4s.ShapeId = smithy4s.ShapeId(&quot;example&quot;, &quot;IntList&quot;) val hints: smithy4s.Hints = smithy4s.Hints.empty val underlyingSchema: smithy4s.Schema[List[Int]] = list(int).withId(id).addHints(hints) implicit val schema: smithy4s.Schema[IntList] = bijection(underlyingSchema, IntList(_), (_: IntList).value) }  It is really similar to named primitives. However, for pragmatic reasons, when a structure references a collection in one of its members, the Scala field gets rendered using the de-aliased type (as opposed to the newtype). The IntList newtype is generated mostly as a way to hold the hints and schemas corresponding to the smithy IntList shape. Additionally, the IntList newtype is used by Smithy4s to render Hints values : namespace example @trait list info { member: String } @info(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;) structure A {}  would lead to the following code being rendered in the companion object of A : val hints: Hints = Hints( example.Info(List(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;)), )  This allows to query Hints for Info using the following syntax: hints.get(example.Info) Regarding the underlyingSchema value in the companion object of IntList, you can see that it is constructed using a list function. Conceptually, it encodes this: &quot;if I'm able to encode or decode an A in a specific format, then I should be able to encode or decode a List[A]&quot;.

Finally-encoded algebras are object-oriented encodings of a set of operations, just like above: operations are represented as methods in an interface. Interpretation of expressions written in terms of these methods does not involve any runtime transformation from one context to another: the method call is merely executed. In other words, when they are executed, expressions coming from finally-encoded algebras are already in their &quot;final form&quot;. Conversely, initially-encoded algebras represent expressions as data, implying that interpretation involves a transformation of this data into lower level method calls. However, data has the quality of being a first class construct in programming languages, meaning you can pass it around and use it as parameter to functions. This allows for the unification of code-paths, as the differences between some aspects of a bit of logic can be absorbed by the data and handled later on. Finally-encoded KVStore algebra : trait KVStore[Context[_]]{ def put(key: String, value: String): Context[Unit] def get(key: String) : Context[Option[String]] def delete(key: String) : Context[Unit] }  Initially-encoded KVStore algebra : sealed trait KVStoreOp[Output] object KVStoreOp { case class Put(key: String, value: String) extends KVStore[Unit] case class Get(key: String) extends KVStore[Option[String]] case class Delete(key: String) extends KVStore[Unit] }  These two encodings contain a similar amount of information. It is nearly-trivial to go from a KVstore[Context] instance to a KVStoreOp ~&gt; Context polymorphic function (natural-transformation), and vice versa: trait ~&gt;[F[_], G[_]]{ def apply[A](fa: F[A]): G[A] } def asNaturalTransformation[Context[_]](impl: KVStore[Context]) = new (KVStoreOp ~&gt; Context){ def apply[A](fa: KVStoreOp[A]): Context[A] = fa match { case KVStoreOp.Put(key, value) =&gt; impl.put(key, value) case KVStoreOp.Get(key) =&gt; impl.get(key) case KVStoreOp.Delete(key) =&gt; impl.delete(key) } } def fromNaturalTransformation[Context[_]](run: KVStoreOp ~&gt; Context) = new KVStore[Context]{ def put(key: String, value: String) = run(KVStoreOp.Put(key, value)) def get(key: String) = run(KVStoreOp.Get(key)) def delete(key: String) = run(KVStoreOp.Delete(key)) }  This duality is heavily used by Smithy4s: finally-encoded interfaces are generally more natural to Scala developers, and are better supported in editors (autocompletion, etc). But from an implementation's perspective, the initial, data-based encoding is really interesting, because operations are reified as data-types that can be associated with instances of generic type-classes: it is possible to abstract over data, it is not possible to abstract over method calls. "},{"title":"A detour around kinds​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services and endpoints","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/services#a-detour-around-kinds","content":"The methods generated by Smithy4s are conceptually similar to the methods expressed in the example above, except that the output types are significantly more verbose. trait Interface[Context[_, _, _, _, _,]]{ def operation1(a: A, b: B): Context[Input, Error, Output, StreamedInput, StreamedOutput] }  Let's address this awkwardness right away, by explaining the rationale behind this seemingly humongous signature : Input​ It's the input type of an operation. Typically, a case class that holds fields matching the method parameters. We keep track of it in the return type for several reasons: In the internal logic of Smithy4s, It prevents having to prematurely shoe-horn kinds into other kinds by means of injection/projection, which helps both implementor and compiler alikeIt will come in handy for the implementation of some pagination-aware interpreters, as pagination typically works by performing a modification of the previous input in order to get the next batch (page) of results. This implies that the input (and therefore its type) must be tracked across several requests resulting from a single method call. Error​ The execution of an operation can result in errors. The Smithy language allows for tying a list of errors to operations. When generating the associated code, Smithy4s synthesize a union. This allows the coproduct of errors associated to an operation to be represented as a bona fide Scala type, which we can abstract over via some type-class instance. This is also very useful for the writing of bi-functor interpreters, for users that are interested in this kind of UX. Output​ No surprise there: this is the data resulting from the run of the operation. StreamedInput, StreamedOutput​ Smithy supports the concept of Streaming. It is communicated as a trait that annotates a single field of the input shape or/and output shape of an operation. Scala does not have a &quot;standard&quot; way of expressing streaming semantics. Moreover, streaming constructs in Scala are heavily context dependant. It is therefore impossible for us to incorporate the concept of &quot;streaming&quot; to our Schema construct as it is meant to be context-free and third-party-free. To get some intuition for why that is: say we want to express streaming using fs2. If we naively generate a case class that has one of its fields annotated with @streaming, it means that the the field is of type fs2.Stream[F, A], which means that we either need to make a decision on what the F is, which is not okay for obvious reasons, or we need to propagate the F[_] type parameter upward to the case class. Now our Schema value, which accompanies the case-class, also have to carry the F ... this propagates throughout the whole codebase. We deemed that not acceptable. Rather than polluting all layers of abstraction, we decided to just have the concept of operation be impacted and hold the streamed type in a separate type parameter. This allows for interpreters from various ecosystem to emerge. It also has the quality of allowing users to access the unary component of outputs (ie, data that is communicated in the headers of HTTP responses) without necessarily allocating resources to consume the streamed component of the output. NB: at the time of writing this, Smithy4s does not have any streaming-aware interpreter implemented. But streaming is such a fundamental notion in remote interactions, and we had to devise a plan to ensure that third parties could decide to implement interpreters without waiting.

Additionally, each structure annotated with @error in smithy is rendered as a case-class that extends Throwable, because Throwables are the de-facto standard of doing error handling on the JVM. Even libraries that use Either to perform error handling often represent the left-hand-side of the Either as some throwable type, to facilitate the absorption of errors into the error-channels of monadic constructs (IO.raiseError, etc) As a result, it is important for Smithy4s to expose functions that generically enable the filtering of throwables against the Error type parameter of an operation, so that interpreters can intercept errors and apply the correct encoding (dictated via Schema) before communicating them back to the caller over the wire. Conversely, it is important to expose a function that allows to go from the generic Error type parameter to Throwable, so that errors received via low-level communication channels can be turned into Throwable at the client call site, in order to populate the relevant error channel when exposing mono-functor semantics. Therefore, when a smithy operation has errors defined, the corresponding smithy4s.Endpoint also extends the Errorable interface, which looks like this : trait Errorable[E] { def error: UnionSchema[E] def liftError(throwable: Throwable): Option[E] def unliftError(e: E): Throwable }  "},{"title":"Services and endpoints​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services and endpoints","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/services#services-and-endpoints","content":"In order to implement any server-side interpreters, it is required to have a list of endpoints.

For instance, smithy provides a @http trait out of the box that can annotate operations : service KVStore { operations: [Get, Put] } @http(method: &quot;GET&quot;, uri: &quot;/resource/${key}, code: 200) operation Get { input: GetInput output: GetOutput } structure GetInput { @httpLabel key: String } structure GetOutput { value: String } @http(method: &quot;PUT&quot;, uri: &quot;/resource/${key}, code: 200) operation Put { } structure PutInput { @httpLabel key: String, @httpPayload value: String }  Each @http occurrence get translated to a scala value in the Hints associated to the corresponding endpoint.

First, let's define the service. $version: &quot;2&quot; namespace smithy4s.guides.auth use alloy#simpleRestJson @simpleRestJson @httpBearerAuth service HelloWorldAuthService { version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;, operations: [SayWorld, HealthCheck] errors: [NotAuthorizedError] }  Here we defined a service that has two operations, SayWorld and HealthCheck. We defined it such that any of these operations may return an NotAuthorizedError. Finally, we annotated the service with the @httpBearerAuth trait to indicate that the service supports authentication via a bearer token. If you are using a different authentication scheme, you can still follow this guide and adapt it for your needs. You can find a full list of smithy-provided schemes here. If none of the provided traits suit your use case, you can always create a custom trait too. Next, let's define our first operation, SayWorld: @readonly @http(method: &quot;GET&quot;, uri: &quot;/hello&quot;, code: 200) operation SayWorld { output: World } structure World { message: String = &quot;World !&quot; }  There is nothing authentication-specific defined with this operation, this means that the operation inherits the service-defined authentication scheme (httpBearerAuth in this case). Let's contrast this with the HealthCheck operation: @readonly @http(method: &quot;GET&quot;, uri: &quot;/health&quot;, code: 200) @auth([]) operation HealthCheck { output := { @required message: String } }  Notice that on this operation we have added the @auth([]) trait with an empty array. This means that there is no authentication required for this endpoint. In other words, although the service defines an authentication scheme of httpBearerAuth, that scheme will not apply to this endpoint. Finally, let's define the NotAuthorizedError that will be returned when an authentication token is missing or invalid. @error(&quot;client&quot;) @httpError(401) structure NotAuthorizedError { @required message: String }  There is nothing authentication specific about this error, this is a standard smithy http error that will have a 401 status code when returned. If you want to see the full smithy model we defined above, you can do so here. "},{"title":"Server-side Middleware​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Endpoint Specific Middleware","url":"/smithy4s/docs/guides/endpoint-middleware#server-side-middleware","content":"To see the full code example of what we walk through below, go here. We will create a server-side middleware that implements the authentication as defined in the smithy spec above. Let's start by creating a few classes that we will use in our middleware. AuthChecker​ case class ApiToken(value: String) trait AuthChecker { def isAuthorized(token: ApiToken): IO[Boolean] } object AuthChecker extends AuthChecker { def isAuthorized(token: ApiToken): IO[Boolean] = { IO.pure( token.value.nonEmpty ) // put your logic here, currently just makes sure the token is not empty } }  This is a simple class that we will use to check the validity of a given token. This will be more complex in your own service, but we are keeping it simple here since it is out of the scope of this article and implementations will vary widely depending on your specific application. The Inner Middleware Implementation​ This function is what is called once we have made sure that the middleware is applicable for a given endpoint. We will show in the next step how to tell if the middleware is applicable or not. For now though, we will just focus on what the middleware does once we know that it needs to be applied to a given endpoint. def middleware( authChecker: AuthChecker // 1 ): HttpApp[IO] =&gt; HttpApp[IO] = { inputApp =&gt; // 2 HttpApp[IO] { request =&gt; // 3 val maybeKey = request.headers // 4 .get[`Authorization`] .collect { case Authorization( Credentials.Token(AuthScheme.Bearer, value) ) =&gt; value } .map { ApiToken.apply } val isAuthorized = maybeKey .map { key =&gt; authChecker.isAuthorized(key) // 5 } .getOrElse(IO.pure(false)) isAuthorized.ifM( ifTrue = inputApp(request), // 6 ifFalse = IO.raiseError(new NotAuthorizedError(&quot;Not authorized!&quot;)) // 7 ) } }  Let's break down what we did above step by step. The step numbers below correspond to the comment numbers above. Pass an instance of AuthChecker that we can use to verify auth tokens are valid in this middlewareinputApp is the HttpApp[IO] that we are transforming in this middleware.Here we create a new HttpApp, the one that we will be returning from this function we are creating.Here we extract the value of the Authorization header, if it is present.If the header had a value, we now send that value into the AuthChecker to see if it is valid.If the token was found to be valid, we pass the request into the inputApp from step 2 in order to get a response.If the header was found to be invalid, we return the NotAuthorizedError that we defined in our smithy file above. ServerEndpointMiddleware.Simple​ Next, let's create our middleware by implementing the ServerEndpointMiddleware.Simple interface we discussed above. object AuthMiddleware { def apply( authChecker: AuthChecker // 1 ): ServerEndpointMiddleware[IO] = new ServerEndpointMiddleware.Simple[IO] { private val mid: HttpApp[IO] =&gt; HttpApp[IO] = middleware(authChecker) // 2 def prepareWithHints( serviceHints: Hints, endpointHints: Hints ): HttpApp[IO] =&gt; HttpApp[IO] = { serviceHints.get[smithy.api.HttpBearerAuth] match { // 3 case Some(_) =&gt; endpointHints.get[smithy.api.Auth] match { // 4 case Some(auths) if auths.value.isEmpty =&gt; identity // 5 case _ =&gt; mid // 6 } case None =&gt; identity } } } }  Pass in an instance of AuthChecker for the middleware to use. This is how the middleware will know if a given token is valid or not.This is the function that we defined in the step above.Check and see if the service at hand does in fact have the httpBearerAuth trait on it. If it doesn't, then we will not do our auth checks. If it does, then we will proceed.Here we are getting the @auth trait from the operation (endpoint in smithy4s lingo). We need to check for this trait because of step 5.Here we are checking that IF the auth trait is on this endpoint AND the auth trait contains an empty array THEN we are performing NO authentication checks. This is how we handle the @auth([]) trait that is present on the HealthCheck operation we defined above.IF the auth trait is NOT present on the operation, OR it is present AND it contains one or more authentication schemes, we apply the middleware. Using the Middleware​ From here, we can pass our middleware into our SimpleRestJsonBuilder as follows: object HelloWorldAuthImpl extends HelloWorldAuthService[IO] { def sayWorld(): IO[World] = World().pure[IO] def healthCheck(): IO[HealthCheckOutput] = HealthCheckOutput(&quot;Okay!&quot;).pure[IO] } val routes = SimpleRestJsonBuilder .routes(HelloWorldAuthImpl) .middleware(AuthMiddleware(AuthChecker)) .resource  And that's it. Now we have a middleware that will apply an authentication check on incoming requests whenever relevant, as defined in our smithy file.

It is possible that you have a client where you want to apply a similar type of middleware that alters some part of a request depending on the endpoint being targeted. In this part of the guide, we will show how you can do this for a client using the same smithy specification we defined above. We will make it so our authentication token is only sent if we are targeting an endpoint which requires it. ClientEndpointMiddleware.Simple​ The interface that we define for this middleware is going to look very similar to the one we defined above. This makes sense because this middleware is effectively the dual of the middleware above. object Middleware { private def middleware(bearerToken: String): Client[IO] =&gt; Client[IO] = { // 1 inputClient =&gt; Client[IO] { request =&gt; val newRequest = request.withHeaders( // 2 Authorization(Credentials.Token(AuthScheme.Bearer, bearerToken)) ) inputClient.run(newRequest) } } def apply(bearerToken: String): ClientEndpointMiddleware[IO] = // 3 new ClientEndpointMiddleware.Simple[IO] { private val mid = middleware(bearerToken) def prepareWithHints( serviceHints: Hints, endpointHints: Hints ): Client[IO] =&gt; Client[IO] = { serviceHints.get[smithy.api.HttpBearerAuth] match { case Some(_) =&gt; endpointHints.get[smithy.api.Auth] match { case Some(auths) if auths.value.isEmpty =&gt; identity case _ =&gt; mid } case None =&gt; identity } } } }  Here we are creating an inner middleware function, just like we did above. The only differences are that this time we are adding a value to the request instead of extracting one from it and we are operating on Client instead of HttpApp.Add the Authorization header to the request and pass it to the inputClient that we are transforming in this middleware.This function is actually the exact same as the function for the middleware we implemented above. The only differences are that this apply method accepts a bearerToken as a parameter and returns a function on Client instead of HttpApp. The provided bearerToken is what we will add into the Authorization header when applicable. SimpleRestJsonBuilder​ As above, we now just need to wire our middleware into our actual implementation. Here we are constructing a client and specifying the middleware we just defined. def apply(http4sClient: Client[IO]): Resource[IO, HelloWorldAuthService[IO]] = SimpleRestJsonBuilder(HelloWorldAuthService) .client(http4sClient) .uri(Uri.unsafeFromString(&quot;http://localhost:9000&quot;)) .middleware(Middleware(&quot;my-token&quot;)) // creating our middleware here .resource  "},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Endpoint Specific Middleware","url":"/smithy4s/docs/guides/endpoint-middleware#conclusion","content":"Once again, if you want to see the full code examples of the above, you can find them here.

At a high level, Smithy4s takes your Smithy model and generates Scala code based on that model. The model is essentially just a Scala representation of the Smithy model. The generated code does not contain any logic for any specific library such as http4s or jsoniter. Instead, it contains abstractions that Smithy4s itself defines that interpreters can be based on. This means that the generated code is not coupled to any library (other than Smithy4s itself). The interpreters that we have created in Smithy4s will then take the generated code and use it to power, for example, an HTTP service that uses http4s and jsoniter. "},{"title":"How we Test Smithy4s​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Testing Smithy4s Applications","url":"/smithy4s/docs/guides/testing#how-we-test-smithy4s","content":"It is important to understand how Smithy4s works so you can begin to conceptualize how we test Smithy4s and its interpreters. We will not go into much detail on this point, but the main ways we test these are through: Unit tests on the interpreters. These tests isolate the interpreters directly and test their functionality. An example of this is the Jsoniter interpreter. We are able to isolate its functionality and test that it is working as intended.Protocol tests. These tests are auto-generated from Smithy-defined traits. They are sort of like integration tests in the sense that they test all the relevant layers of a smithy4s application by connecting, for example, the HTTP layer with the JSON serialization layer. The main goal of these tests is to make sure that Smithy4s is handling edge cases properly and overall conforms to the protocol(s) we have defined. For more on protocol testing, you can check out the Smithy documentation. "},{"title":"Testing your API​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Testing Smithy4s Applications","url":"/smithy4s/docs/guides/testing#testing-your-api","content":"Now the question that remains is what all of this means for your applications which use Smithy4s. Our basic recommendation is going to come down to: test what you feel needs to be tested, but make sure you understand what it is that you are testing. For example, we would not generally recommend that you test the Smithy4s interpreters in your code (for example the http4s routes that you get when you use SimpleRestJsonBuilder). One of the main appeals of Smithy4s is that it abstracts away concerns such as request routing and the encoding/decoding of payloads. This is why we strive to be thorough in our testing: so you don't need to worry about testing whether or not Smithy4s is doing its job. That being said, if you don't trust Smithy4s and want to test it anyway, that is totally fine too. Ultimately Smithy4s as a project will benefit if you do test it and find any bugs that we can then fix. So in any case, we are supportive of your decision. Another reason you may think of testing the Smithy4s interpreters is to make sure that their implementation, such as the way they encode something in JSON, lines up with some requirements that you have. This is fair enough, but realize that the thing you are really testing here is your understanding of how Smithy4s works. That may be worth your while, or it may not be. The decision is ultimately up to you. If this is your reason for testing, you may want to explore contract-based testing as outlined below. Note that if you are going to test Smithy4s interpreter behaviors, you should not use Smithy4s to test them. We have occasionally seen the pattern where someone uses a Smithy4s client to test a Smithy4s server. This type of testing has very little benefit since much of the same logic is used for each of these interpreters. This means that the interpreters you are testing could both have the same bug and your tests would not catch it. On the other hand, we do recommend that you test the implementation of your service. For example, if Smithy4s generates a service interface called HelloWorldService, you will implement that interface and place your business logic within it. We recommend that you test all of your business logic since this is outside the scope of what Smithy4s controls.

Note that schema-based tests and contract-based test are not the same thing. Schema tests are concerned with checking that the data sent and received conforms to a specified schema or schemas. An example where contract testing differs is, for example, a client may expect a certain error response to be returned whenever certain conditions are met in the request. A schema can capture what errors may possibly be sent, but it will not capture which error should be triggered by a specific request. For your specific use case, you may have a need to employ schema-based and/or contract-based testing. Schema based testing would be one way of checking that schema changes over time do not impact existing clients. Contract-based testing could accomplish this same thing and more. However, contract based testing is usually more difficult to implement than schema-based testing so you may find it not to be worth it for your use case.

This information is used automatically by downstream projects using Smithy4s, which automatically pulls additional jars that would be specified in this bit of metadata.

This effectively means that smithy files in downstream can use the Smithy shapes present in the smithy-aws-iam-traits artifact. One side-effect of this is that if you produce JARs containing artifacts produced by Smithy4s code generation, they'll contain some common files with other smithy projects, particularly within the META-INF folder.

First, some imports: import cats.effect._ import org.http4s._ import org.http4s.client.Client import smithy4s.compliancetests._ import smithy4s.example.test._ import smithy4s.http4s._ import smithy4s.kinds._ import smithy4s.Service  Then, you can create and instance of ClientHttpComplianceTestCase and/or ServerHttpComplianceTestCase while selecting the protocol to use and the service to test: object SimpleRestJsonIntegration extends Router[IO] with ReverseRouter[IO] { type Protocol = alloy.SimpleRestJson val protocolTag = alloy.SimpleRestJson def codecs = SimpleRestJsonBuilder.codecs def routes[Alg[_[_, _, _, _, _]]]( impl: FunctorAlgebra[Alg, IO] )(implicit service: Service[Alg]): Resource[IO, HttpRoutes[IO]] = SimpleRestJsonBuilder(service).routes(impl).resource def reverseRoutes[Alg[_[_, _, _, _, _]]](app: HttpApp[IO])(implicit service: Service[Alg] ): Resource[IO, FunctorAlgebra[Alg, IO]] = { import org.http4s.implicits._ val baseUri = uri&quot;http://localhost/&quot; SimpleRestJsonBuilder(service) .client(Client.fromHttpApp(app)) .uri(baseUri) .resource } } val tests: List[ComplianceTest[IO]] = HttpProtocolCompliance .clientAndServerTests(SimpleRestJsonIntegration, HelloWorldService)  Now, you can iterate over the test cases and do what you want.

TCP/IP is a framework that organizes these various layers and the protocols therein. The layers are usually divided up, from lowest to highest, as follows: Network Access Layer​ This layer is used to refer to the hardware that exists to facilitate the connections and protocols at higher levels. In other words, this layer is concerned with the physical transmission of data from one place to another. Internet Layer​ This layer is mainly composed of the Internet Protocol. The Internet Protocol is what allows identifying and locating hosts on a network. The &quot;IP&quot; in &quot;IPv4&quot; and &quot;IPv6&quot; stands for &quot;Internet Protocol&quot; and those are two respective versions of that protocol. Transport Layer​ At this point live the TCP and UDP protocols. These protocols take two different approaches to the transferring of messages between two hosts. Application Layer​ Finally, at the top layer we have the protocol that we are all familiar with: http. Other examples of application-layer protocols are FTP, SSH, and SMTP. All of these protocols define their own procedures for interactions between host applications. Essentially, they are adding more structure to interactions that use TCP or UDP underneath. HTTP, for example, uses TCP to facilitate connections. Summary​ In summary, TCP/IP is a collection of protocols, grouped into layers, that make up the basis for interactions between computers. "},{"title":"HTTP​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is a Protocol?","url":"/smithy4s/docs/protocols/definition#http","content":"Before we move on, let's make sure we have a common understanding of what HTTP actually is. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. As mentioned above, it builds upon TCP to send messages between two hosts. The most important thing for us to understand here is what HTTP defines and what it does not define. HTTP defines semantics for communicating between host applications in a request-response model. We are all likely familiar with making an HTTP request and getting back a response. The most basic example of this is loading a web page on the internet. Below is a collection of things that HTTP DOES define. Note that we are not going to be exhaustive in our definition of HTTP. The below is just to give an overview. Request and Response Headers​ HTTP defines that each request and response may have headers which contain additional information related to the request or response. These are key-value pairs where the key is case-insensitive. Request Methods​ Requests have methods such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE (there are currently 9 total). These methods are intended to inform the destination application what the requester wishes to do with a given resource. Response Status Codes​ Responses in HTTP come with an integer status code that represents the category of the result of the request. For example a status code between 200 and 299 is used to indicate that a request was successful. Message Body​ HTTP defines that requests and responses each have an optional message body. This is usually where the majority of information is contained. Things NOT Defined in HTTP​ Now that we have covered the basis of what HTTP defines, it is important to call out a few things that it does not define. The most major thing left out of the HTTP specification is the format for data in the body of requests and responses. As far as HTTP is concerned, these bodies are just Bytes. Defining what these bodies look like is left to higher-level protocols (as we will discuss below). HTTP also does not define what types of resources requests should be able to work with. This means requests can be used to get or modify files stored in a system, in memory state, a third party API, or anything else one could imagine. Additionally, although HTTP provides some mechanisms for basic authentication, it does not define anything around authorization. Other protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 are often used with HTTP applications. REST vs HTTP​ Here is a quick note about REST since REST is often used interchangeably with HTTP despite the fact that they are two different things. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is an architectural pattern. It is important to realize that REST is not backed by a strict RFC or other definition for what it means like HTTP is. As such, how the pattern is implemented varies throughout the industry. RESTful systems might use HTTP, but they don't need to. Similarly, HTTP services may be RESTful, but they don't need to be. The two are related, but are not the same and one does not require the other. "},{"title":"High Level Protocols​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is a Protocol?","url":"/smithy4s/docs/protocols/definition#high-level-protocols","content":"Here we will discuss several &quot;High Level Protocols.&quot; There isn't an official term for these, but we will coin them as such to differentiate them from the protocols discussed above. All of the following protocols build on top of HTTP (although they don't have to), but define different semantics on top of it. alloy#simpleRestJson​ The main protocol that we have defined for use in smithy4s is alloy#simpleRestJson. This protocol uses RESTful HTTP semantics and has HTTP bodies that are encoded as JSON. Essentially, this protocol is building on the various protocols we defined above, and just adding some constraints around how they are used. There are more constraints around how the JSON is encoded and a few other things which you can read about in full in the alloy documentation. gRPC​ gRPC is a framework for remote procedure calls. At the same time, we can consider it to be another protocol that is defined at the same level that alloy#simpleRestJson is defined. gRPC, in its current implementation, uses HTTP version 2 under the hood. It has additional definition around what the HTTP interactions look like such as the bodies being encoded with protocol buffers (protobuf). Additionally, all gRPC messages are sent with the HTTP POST method and use a specific header to specify which remote procedure is being invoked. There are quite a few other nuanced requirements for what makes up the gRPC protocol, but hopefully these few have showed you how gRPC builds on what HTTP provides to create a unique interaction pattern. AWS Protocols​ AWS themselves have defined quite a few protocols in Smithy. Examples of this range from aws.protocols#restJson1 which is very similar to alloy#simpleRestJson to aws.protocols#restXml. You can read more about these protocols in the Smithy documentation. "},{"title":"Protocols in Smithy​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is a Protocol?","url":"/smithy4s/docs/protocols/definition#protocols-in-smithy","content":"In the context of Smithy, a protocol is a set of concrete rules that define how data modelled in Smithy gets transcribed into lower-level semantics. A protocol definition in Smithy can be accompanied by a set of trait annotations which hold further information about how the Smithy shapes are transcribed. For example, the alloy#simpleRestJson protocol relies on the smithy.api#http trait annotation to provide information about which HTTP endpoint will map to each Smithy operation shape. Without the smithy.api#http trait, one would not be able to specify the protocol-specific semantics of an API. This is how Smithy, the language itself, is protocol agnostic while still allowing users to define APIs which conform to various protocols. How to Define a Protocol​ Protocols can be defined in Smithy as traits that are marked with the @protocolDefinition trait. For example, the (slightly simplified) definition of alloy#simpleRestJson looks like: namespace alloy @protocolDefinition() @trait(selector: &quot;service&quot;) structure simpleRestJson {}  This then allows you to annotate service shapes with the protocol. Although the protocol is defined in Smithy like this, the exact meaning of the protocol is defined elsewhere in documentation and more importantly in interpreters that implement the protocol (such as the interpreters that smithy4s uses to create http4s applications). Additionally, protocol definitions typically come with test cases, also defined in Smithy, which help to define the specific semantics of the protocol.

Instead, Smithy4s relies on a number of highly polymorphic interfaces to communicate with the generated code, and derive JSON codecs out of it, or turn high level user provided code into HTTP services. But in theory, the same generated code can be used conjointly with other serialisation technologies (protobuf for instance) and protocols (gRPC). Protocol specific &quot;hints&quot; (called traits)can be added to the smithy models. Smithy4s accurately renders corresponding values, and allows for their retrieval via the polymorphic interfaces. This is how HTTP semantics can be derived from the generated code, for instance. Smithy4s is also not tied to any third-party library, and users could provide integrations with existing libraries on their own side, or come up with new interesting usecases.

The header's value can be either the ShapeId of the error it is targeting OR the name without the namespace. The value of this header is case sensitive. Here are some examples of an X-Error-Type header: X-Error-Type: NotFoundError AND X-Error-Type: example.test#NotFoundError could each be used to map to the error type NotFoundError. This of course assumes that the NotFoundError is provided in either the service or operation errors array provided in the smithy model. All smithy4s services provide an X-Error-Type in responses by default. Status Code​ If the X-Error-Type header is not defined, smithy4s clients will use the status code to attempt to decide which error type to utilize. It does so as follows: If there is a single Error type that contains the correct status code in the httpError trait, this type will be used. If there are two error types with the same status code, an UnknownErrorResponse will be surfaced to the client.If there is NOT a matching status code, but there is a single error marked with the error trait, this error type will be used as long as the returned status code is in the range for either a client or server error. In other words if a single error shape has no status code, but is annotated with @error(&quot;client&quot;) and the returned status code is 404 then this error type will be used. If there are multiple error types with no status code and a matching error type (client/server), then an UnknownErrorResponse will be surfaced to the client. Here are some examples to show more what this looks like. Example smithy model: operation TestOp { ... errors: [NotFoundError, ServiceUnavailableError, CatchAllClientError, CatchAllServerError] } @httpError(404) @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure NotFoundError { message: String } @httpError(503) @error(&quot;server&quot;) structure ServiceUnavailableError { message: String } @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure CatchAllClientError { message String } @error(&quot;server&quot;) structure CatchAllServerError { message String }  And here are some scenarios using this example model. For all of these, assume that NO X-Error-Type header is provided. Status Code\tError Selected404\tNotFoundError 400\tCatchAllClientError 503\tServiceUnavailableError 500\tCatchAllServerError However, adding another error to the operation that looks like: @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure AnotherError { message: String }  Would result in the following: Status Code\tError Selected404\tNotFoundError 400\tUnknownErrorResponse 503\tServiceUnavailableError 500\tCatchAllServerError Notice that the 400 status code cannot be properly mapped. This is because there is no exact match AND there are two errors that are labeled with @error(&quot;client&quot;) which also do not have an associated httpError trait containing a status code. Adding another error type to the operation that looks like: @httpError(404) @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure AnotherNotFoundError { message: String }  Will result in the following: Status Code\tError Selected404\tUnknownErrorResponse 400\tUnknownErrorResponse 503\tServiceUnavailableError 500\tCatchAllServerError Now the 404 status code cannot be mapped. This is due to the fact that two different error types are annotated with a 404 httpError trait. This means that the smithy4s client is not able to decide which of these errors is correct.

The mapErrors and flatMapErrors methods can be used to ensure that a specified error is returned by your service: myRoutes.mapErrors{ case e: PayloadError =&gt; MyClientError(...) }.resource  "},{"title":"Wiring the routes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"SimpleRestJson server","url":"/smithy4s/docs/protocols/simple-rest-json/server#wiring-the-routes","content":"As a reminder, to wire those routes into a server, you need something like: import cats.effect._ import org.http4s.ember.server._ import org.http4s.implicits._ import com.comcast.ip4s._ object Main extends IOApp { def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = Routes.myRoutes.flatMap { routes =&gt; EmberServerBuilder.default[IO] .withPort(port&quot;9000&quot;) .withHost(host&quot;localhost&quot;) .withHttpApp(routes.orNotFound) .build }.use(_ =&gt; IO.never) .as(ExitCode.Success) }  "},{"title":"Editor Support","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/smithy4s/docs/the-smithy-idl/editor-support","content":"Editor Support Disney Streaming develops and maintains a Smithy language server, that implements features such as jump-to-definition, auto-completion, validation diagnostics.

The getMessage method of the throwable is implemented in terms of the following (based on the first match): a field annotated with the @errorMessage traita field named message Services​ Services are basically a list of operations, and an optional list of errors. namespace foo service HelloService { operations: [Greet] errors: [ServerError] } @error(&quot;server&quot;) structure ServerError { message: String }  Smithy4s translates them in the following fashion: package object foo { type HelloService[F[_]] = HelloServiceGen[???] }  HelloService is type alias that exposes a normal &quot;functor-shaped&quot; type parameter: we are aware that the most common usecase of Smithy4s abides by the &quot;capatibility trait&quot; pattern (or tagless-final), against effect types that probably abide by the cats-effect semantics. However, the actual interface is HelloServiceGen, which has a higher degree of polymorphism. It looks like this: package foo trait HelloServiceGen[P[_, _, _, _, _]]{ def greet(name: String): P[GreetInput, Greet.Error, GreetOutput, Nothing, Nothing] }  P represents an abstract context against which operations are going to run. The abstract context has 5 type parameters: inputerroroutputstreamed input (Nothing, most of the time)streamed output (Nothing, most of the time) Keeping track of these parameters is really important for the implementation intepreters. It also opens the door for providing interpreters that work against bi-functors (EitherT[IO, *, *]) without changing the generated code.
