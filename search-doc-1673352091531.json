[{"title":"Algebraic data types","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/smithy4s/docs/codegen/customisation/adts","content":"Algebraic data types The default behavior of Smithy4s when rendering unions that target structures is to render the structure in a separate file from the union that targets it. This makes sense if the structure is used in other contexts other than the union. However, it also causes an extra level of nesting within the union. This is because the union will create another case class to contain your structure case class. For example: union OrderType { inStore: InStoreOrder } structure InStoreOrder { @required id: OrderNumber locationId: String } Would render the following scala code: OrderType.scala: sealed trait OrderType extends scala.Product with scala.Serializable case class InStoreCase(inStore: InStoreOrder) extends OrderType InStoreOrder.scala: case class InStoreOrder(id: OrderNumber, locationId: Option[String] = None) The sealed hierarchy OrderType has a member named InStoreCase. This is becauseInStoreOrder is rendered in a separate file and OrderType is sealed. However, adding the adtMember trait to the InStoreOrder structure changes this. union OrderType { inStore: InStoreOrder } @adtMember(OrderType) // added the adtMember trait here structure InStoreOrder { @required id: OrderNumber locationId: String } sealed trait OrderType extends scala.Product with scala.Serializable case class InStoreOrder(id: OrderNumber, locationId: Option[String] = None) extends OrderType The IsStoreOrder class has now been updated to be rendered directly as a member of the OrderTypesealed hierarchy. The adtMember trait can be applied to any structure as long as said structure is targeted by EXACTLY ONE union.This means it must be targeted by the union that is provided as parameter to the adtMember trait. This constraint is fulfilled above because OrderType targets InStoreOrder and InStoreOrder is annotated with @adtMember(OrderType). The structure annotated with adtMember (e.g. InStoreOrder) also must not be targeted by any other structures or unions in the model. There is a validator that will make sure these requirements are met whenever the adtMember trait is in use. Note: The adtMember trait has NO impact on the serialization/deserialization behaviors of Smithy4s. The only thing it changes is what the generated code looks like.

Creating a refinement for use in your application starts with creating a custom smithy trait that represents the refinement. namespace test @trait(selector: &quot;string&quot;) structure emailFormat {} This trait can now be used on string shapes to indicate that they must match an email format. @emailFormat string Email Now we need to tell smithy4s that we want to represent shapes annotated with @emailFormat as a custom type that we define. Given a custom email type such as: // Note, we recommend using a newtype library over a regular case class in most cases // But this is shown to simplify the example case class Email(value: String) object Email { private def isValidEmail(value: String): Boolean = ??? def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] = if (isValidEmail(value)) Right(new Email(value)) else Left(&quot;Email is not valid&quot;) } Next, we will need to provide a way for smithy4s to understand how to construct and deconstruct our Email type. We do this by defining an instance of a RefinementProvider. Note that the RefinementProvider we create MUST be implicit. // package myapp.types import smithy4s._ case class Email(value: String) object Email { private def isValidEmail(value: String): Boolean = ??? def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] = if (isValidEmail(value)) Right(new Email(value)) else Left(&quot;Email is not valid&quot;) implicit val provider = Refinement.drivenBy[EmailFormat]( Email.apply, // Tells smithy4s how to create an Email (or get an error message) given a string (e: Email) =&gt; e.value // Tells smithy4s how to get a string from an Email ) } info The EmailFormat type passed as a type parameter to Refinement.drivenBy is the type that smithy4s generated from our @emailFormat trait we defined in our smithy file earlier. Now, we just have one thing left to do: tell smithy4s where to find our custom Email type. We do this using a trait called smithy4s.meta#refinement. use smithy4s.meta#refinement apply test#emailFormat @refinement( targetType: &quot;myapp.types.Email&quot; ) Here we are applying the refinement trait to our emailFormat trait we defined earlier. We are providing the targetType which is our Email case class we defined. Smithy4s will now be able to update how it does code generation to reference our custom Email type. info If the provider was not in the companion object of our targetType, we would need to provide the providerImport to the refinement trait so that smithy4s would be able to find it. For example: use smithy4s.meta#refinement apply test#emailFormat @refinement( targetType: &quot;myapp.types.Email&quot;, providerImport: &quot;myapp.types.providers._&quot; ) Whether the provider is in the companion object or not, it must be implicit. Parameterised Types​ As of smithy4s version 0.17, you can now create refinements on types that take a generic type parameter. This can be accomplished by setting parameterised to true as seen below. @trait(selector: &quot;list&quot;) @refinement( targetType: &quot;smithy4s.example.refined.NonEmptyList&quot;, parameterised: true ) structure nonEmptyListFormat {} Following this, we now need to create our refinement provider as we did with the example above. In this case, we will use an implicit function so we can reference the generic type parameter A. This allows us to use the same implementation of NonEmptyList across lists containing any type. import smithy4s._ case class NonEmptyList[A] private (values: List[A]) object NonEmptyList { def apply[A](values: List[A]): Either[String, NonEmptyList[A]] = if (values.size &gt; 0) Right(new NonEmptyList(values)) else Left(&quot;List must not be empty.&quot;) implicit def provider[A] = Refinement.drivenBy[NonEmptyListFormat]( NonEmptyList.apply[A], (b: NonEmptyList[A]) =&gt; b.values ) } Now we can apply our nonEmptyListFormat trait as follows: @nonEmptyListFormat list NonEmptyStrings { member: String } In the generated Scala code, this will render as a NonEmptyList[String] instead of a List[String]. Similarly, we can apply the nonEmptyListFormat trait to any list shape and it will render as a NonEmptyList. This works for all shapes that can be specified as list members including primitives, structures, collections, and even other refined types.","keywords":""},{"title":"New types (and unwrapping)","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/smithy4s/docs/codegen/customisation/unwrapping","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Default rendering​","type":1,"pageTitle":"New types (and unwrapping)","url":"/smithy4s/docs/codegen/customisation/unwrapping#default-rendering","content":"Smithy4s allows you to customize how defaults on the fields of smithy structures are rendered inside of case classes.

Rather, the Smithy models dictates the encoding. Indeed, there are multiple ways to encode unions in JSON. By default, the specification of the Smithy language hints that the tagged-union encoding should be used. This is arguably the best encoding for unions, as it works with members of any type (not just structures), and does not require backtracking during parsing, which makes it more efficient. However, Smithy4s provides support for two additional encodings: discriminated and untagged, which users can opt-in via the alloy#discriminated and alloy#untagged trait, respectively. These are mostly offered as a way to retrofit existing APIs in Smithy. Tagged union​ This is the default behaviour, and happens to visually match how Smithy unions are declared. In this encoding, the union is encoded as a JSON object with a single key-value pair, the key signalling which alternative has been encoded. union Tagged { first: String second: IntWrapper } structure IntWrapper { int: Integer }  The following instances of Tagged Tagged.FirstCase(&quot;smithy4s&quot;) Tagged.SecondCase(IntWrapper(42)))  are encoded as such : { &quot;first&quot;: &quot;smithy4s&quot; } { &quot;second&quot;: { &quot;int&quot;: 42 } }  Untagged union​ Untagged unions are supported via an annotation: @untagged. Despite the smaller payload size this encoding produces, it is arguably the worst way of encoding unions, as it may require backtracking multiple times on the parsing side. Use this carefully, preferably only when you need to retrofit an existing API into Smithy use alloy#untagged @untagged union Untagged { first: String second: IntWrapper } structure IntWrapper { int: Integer }  The following instances of Untagged Untagged.FirstCase(&quot;smithy4s&quot;) Untagged.SecondCase(Two(42)))  are encoded as such : &quot;smithy4s&quot; { &quot;int&quot;: 42 }  Discriminated union​ Discriminated union are supported via an annotation: @discriminated(&quot;tpe&quot;), and work only when all members of the union are structures. In this encoding, the discriminator is inlined as a JSON field within JSON object resulting from the encoding of the member. Despite the JSON payload exhibiting less nesting than in the tagged union encoding, this encoding often leads to bigger payloads, and requires backtracking once during parsing. use alloy#discriminated @discriminated(&quot;tpe&quot;) union Discriminated { first: StringWrapper second: IntWrapper } structure StringWrapper { string: String } structure IntWrapper { int: Integer }  The following instances of Discriminated Discriminated.FirstCase(StringWrapper(&quot;smithy4s&quot;)) Discriminated.SecondCase(IntWrapper(42)))  are encoded as such { &quot;tpe&quot;: &quot;first&quot;, &quot;string&quot;: &quot;smithy4s&quot; } { &quot;tpe&quot;: &quot;second&quot;, &quot;int&quot;: 42 }  "},{"title":"Datatypes and schemas","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/schemas","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"The Schema GADT​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Datatypes and schemas","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/schemas#the-schema-gadt","content":"Each datatype generated by Smithy4s is accompanied by a schema value in its companion object, which contains an expression of type smithy4s.schema.Schema that captures everything needed to deconstruct/reconstruct instances of the datatype. smithy4s.schema.Schema is a Generalised Algebraic Datatype (or GADT for short) that can be used to precisely reference all the information needed to traverse datatypes that can be expressed in Smithy. It is a bit like JVM reflection, except that it exposes higher-level information about the datatypes. It achieves this by exposing building blocks that accurately reflect what is possible to express in the Smithy language. These building blocks form a metamodel: a model for models. And, unlike JVM reflection, using schemas is type-safe. The Schema type reflects the various ways of constructing datatypes in Smithy. It is encoded as a sealed trait, the members of which capture the following aspects of the Smithy language: PrimitivesListsSetsMapsEnumerationsStructuresUnions For a Scala type called Foo, formulating a Schema[Foo] is equivalent to exhaustively capturing the information needed for the serialisation and deserialisation of Foo in any format (JSON, XML, ...). Indeed, for any Codec[_] construct provided by third-party libraries, it is possible to write a generic def compile(schema: Schema[A]): Codec[A] function that produces the Codec for A based on the information held by the Schema. Why do things this way? Why not just render Codec during code generation? The reason is that we want for the generated code to be completely decoupled from any serialisation format or library, and for the user to have the ability to wire that generated code in different ways, without having to change anything in the build. Moreover, this approach has proven that it allows for a bounded investment for adding interop with various libraries, and offers really good testability.

Smithy4s generically translates these annotations to instances of the corresponding generated classes, which means that Smithy4s supports generating user defined traits that it has zero knowledge of. So if you have the following Smithy description: namespace example @trait structure metadata { @required description: String } @metadata(description: &quot;This is my own integer shape&quot;) integer MyInt  When processing this Smithy model, Smithy4s renders a case class Metadata(description: String), with an assocaited ShapeTag[Metadata] instance, and the following expression in the companion object of MyInt: val hints = Hints( Metadata(&quot;this is my own integer shape&quot;) )  The smithy4s.Hints type is a polymorphic map that can hold shapes, keyed by ShapeTag. A ShapeTag is a uniquely identified tag that uses referential equality. Every schema can hold a Hints instance, which means that in addition to the datatype structures, Schemas also offer an accurate reflection of the trait values that annotate shapes in the smithy models. Smithy4s uses these hints to implement interpreters. For instance, the smithy.api#jsonName smithy trait translates to a smithy.api.JsonName Scala type, that we can query from a Hints instance when implementing a Schema ~&gt; JsonCodec transformation. This allows to give users a little customisability in the json serialisation of their datatypes. "},{"title":"Structures​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Datatypes and schemas","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/schemas#structures","content":"A structure, also referred to as product, or record, is a construct that groups several values together. Typically, it translates naturally to a case class. namespace example structure Foo { @required a: Integer @length(min: 1) b: String }  ...and the associated, generated Scala code: package example import smithy4s.schema.Schema._ case class Foo(a: Int, b: Option[String] = None) object Foo extends smithy4s.ShapeTag.Companion[Foo] { val id: smithy4s.ShapeId = smithy4s.ShapeId(&quot;example&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;) implicit val schema: smithy4s.Schema[Foo] = struct( int.required[Foo](&quot;a&quot;, _.a), string.optional[Foo](&quot;b&quot;, _.b).addHints(smithy.api.Length(Some(1), None)) ){ Foo.apply }.withId(id) }  As you can see, the Smithy structure translates quite naturally to a Scala case class. Every member of the structure that does not have the @required trait is rendered as an optional value defaulting to None (by default, smithy4s sorts the fields before rendering the case class so that the required ones appear before the optional ones. That is a pragmatic decision that tends to improve UX for users.) Indeed, for each field, there is an associated reference to a schema (int, string, ...), a string label, and a lambda calling the case class accessor that allows the retrieval of the associated field value. Additionally, the constructor of the case class is also referenced in the Schema. Typically, the accessors are needed for encoding the data, which involves destructuring it to access its individual components. The labels are there to cater to serialisation mechanisms like JSON or XML, where sub-components of a piece of data are labelled and nested under a larger block. Conversely, the constructor is used for deserialisation, which involves reconstructing the data after all of its component values have been successfully deserialised. Another detail is the presence of the addHints call on field labelled with b. This is due to the presence of the length trait (from the smithy.api namespace, aka the prelude) on the corresponding b member of the smithy Foo shape. Note related to optional and required​ You may have noticed the required and optional methods, which create Field instances from Schemas, in order to pass them to structures. In Smithy4s, the concept of Option only exists relatively to struct calls. It is not possible to construct a Schema[Option[A]] on its own. The rationale is that having a first class Option schema constructor leads to leaks in the implementation of serialisation mechanisms, as None typically represents the absence of value, and allowing for serialising an absence of value in formats that typically do not support it implies the leak of Option (or equivalent) in various interfaces. Additionally, a first class Option schema constructor would allow to create schemas for Option[Option[Option[Int]]], and even though we recognise that there are some things that could be encoded this way, it is just not a very pragmatic possibility, and opens the door for easy violation of round-trip properties that any serialisation technology should respect. For instance: Some(None) and None can easily have the same encoding in Json, so how do you distinguish between the two during decoding? "},{"title":"Unions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Datatypes and schemas","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/schemas#unions","content":"Union, also referred to as coproduct, or sum type, is a construct that expresses sealed polymorphism. It is the dual of a structure: when structures express that you have A AND B, unions express that you can have A OR B. The way this is expressed in Smithy looks like this: namespace example union Bar { a: Integer b: String }  This hints at the default serialisation that AWS has intended to use on unions expressed in smithy, namely tagged unions. Indeed, the AWS json-centric protocols specifies that shapes like these should be serialised in objects with a single key/value entry, where the key receives the value of the tag. For instance, { &quot;a&quot;: 1 } or { &quot;b&quot;: &quot;two&quot; }. There are some very relevant technical reasons for it, but this way of encoding unions/co-products in JSON is arguably the best. It may also be familiar to Circe users as it's the default encoding of co-products in circe-generic. Regarding the Scala code rendered by Smithy4s for the above Smithy specification, it looks like this: package example import smithy4s.schema.Schema._ sealed trait Bar extends scala.Product with scala.Serializable object Bar extends smithy4s.ShapeTag.Companion[Bar] { val id: smithy4s.ShapeId = smithy4s.ShapeId(&quot;foobar&quot;, &quot;Bar&quot;) case class ACase(a: Int) extends Bar case class BCase(b: String) extends Bar object ACase { val hints: smithy4s.Hints = smithy4s.Hints.empty val schema: smithy4s.Schema[ACase] = bijection(int.addHints(hints), ACase(_), _.a) val alt = schema.oneOf[Bar](&quot;a&quot;) } object BCase { val hints: smithy4s.Hints = smithy4s.Hints.empty val schema: smithy4s.Schema[BCase] = bijection(string.addHints(hints), BCase(_), _.b) val alt = schema.oneOf[Bar](&quot;b&quot;) } implicit val schema: smithy4s.Schema[Bar] = union( ACase.alt, BCase.alt, ){ case c: ACase =&gt; ACase.alt(c) case c: BCase =&gt; BCase.alt(c) }.withId(id) }  The union is rendered as an ADT (sealed trait), the members of which are single-value case classes wrapping values of the types referenced by the union member. The Case suffix is added as a way to reduce risk of collision between the generated code and other types (especially the types being wrapped). Each ADT member is accompanied by its own schema, which is not provided implicitly, in an effort to retain coherence in the type-class instances, and avoid the situation where you'd have different behaviours during serialisation based on whether you've up-casted a member to the ADT. Additionally, the companion objects of each ADT members contain an alt value (for &quot;alternative&quot;), which is the union's equivalent to the structure's field. Much like a field, an alt contains a label, and can carry hints. But unlike a field, which contains an accessor, the alt contains the function to &quot;inject&quot; (up-cast) the member into the union. This is useful for de-serialisation, when, after successfully de-serialising a member of a union, you need to inject it into the ADT to return the expected type. As for the union's schema, it is somewhat similar to the structure's, in that it references all its alternatives. But instead of a structure's constructor, we have a dispatch function instead, which contains a pattern match against all the possible members, and dispatches the &quot;down-casted&quot; value to its corresponding alternative. This is useful for serialisation, when the behaviour of the alternatives can only be applied to values of the corresponding type: &quot;if my ADT is an A, then I serialise the A, and add a discriminating tag to the serialised A&quot;.

However, for pragmatic reasons, when a structure references a collection in one of its members, the Scala field gets rendered using the de-aliased type (as opposed to the newtype). The IntList newtype is generated mostly as a way to hold the hints and schemas corresponding to the smithy IntList shape. Additionally, the IntList newtype is used by Smithy4s to render Hints values : namespace example @trait list info { member: String } @info(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;) structure A {}  would lead to the following code being rendered in the companion object of A : val hints: Hints = Hints( example.Info(List(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;)), )  This allows to query Hints for Info using the following syntax: hints.get(example.Info) Regarding the underlyingSchema value in the companion object of IntList, you can see that it is constructed using a list function.

However, data has the quality of being a first class construct in programming languages, meaning you can pass it around and use it as parameter to functions. This allows for the unification of code-paths, as the differences between some aspects of a bit of logic can be absorbed by the data and handled later on. Finally-encoded KVStore algebra : trait KVStore[Context[_]]{ def put(key: String, value: String): Context[Unit] def get(key: String) : Context[Option[String]] def delete(key: String) : Context[Unit] }  Initially-encoded KVStore algebra : sealed trait KVStoreOp[Output] object KVStoreOp { case class Put(key: String, value: String) extends KVStore[Unit] case class Get(key: String) extends KVStore[Option[String]] case class Delete(key: String) extends KVStore[Unit] }  These two encodings contain a similar amount of information. It is nearly-trivial to go from a KVstore[Context] instance to a KVStoreOp ~&gt; Context polymorphic function (natural-transformation), and vice versa: trait ~&gt;[F[_], G[_]]{ def apply[A](fa: F[A]): G[A] } def asNaturalTransformation[Context[_]](impl: KVStore[Context]) = new (KVStoreOp ~&gt; Context){ def apply[A](fa: KVStoreOp[A]): Context[A] = fa match { case KVStoreOp.Put(key, value) =&gt; impl.put(key, value) case KVStoreOp.Get(key) =&gt; impl.get(key) case KVStoreOp.Delete(key) =&gt; impl.delete(key) } } def fromNaturalTransformation[Context[_]](run: KVStoreOp ~&gt; Context) = new KVStore[Context]{ def put(key: String, value: String) = run(KVStoreOp.Put(key, value)) def get(key: String) = run(KVStoreOp.Get(key)) def delete(key: String) = run(KVStoreOp.Delete(key)) }  This duality is heavily used by Smithy4s: finally-encoded interfaces are generally more natural to Scala developers, and are better supported in editors (autocompletion, etc). But from an implementation's perspective, the initial, data-based encoding is really interesting, because operations are reified as data-types that can be associated with instances of generic type-classes: it is possible to abstract over data, it is not possible to abstract over method calls. "},{"title":"A detour around kinds​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services and endpoints","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/services#a-detour-around-kinds","content":"The methods generated by Smithy4s are conceptually similar to the methods expressed in the example above, except that the output types are significantly more verbose. trait Interface[Context[_, _, _, _, _,]]{ def operation1(a: A, b: B): Context[Input, Error, Output, StreamedInput, StreamedOutput] }  Let's address this awkwardness right away, by explaining the rationale behind this seemingly humongous signature : Input​ It's the input type of an operation. Typically, a case class that holds fields matching the method parameters. We keep track of it in the return type for several reasons: In the internal logic of Smithy4s, It prevents having to prematurely shoe-horn kinds into other kinds by means of injection/projection, which helps both implementor and compiler alikeIt will come in handy for the implementation of some pagination-aware interpreters, as pagination typically works by performing a modification of the previous input in order to get the next batch (page) of results. This implies that the input (and therefore its type) must be tracked across several requests resulting from a single method call. Error​ The execution of an operation can result in errors. The Smithy language allows for tying a list of errors to operations. When generating the associated code, Smithy4s synthesize a union. This allows the coproduct of errors associated to an operation to be represented as a bona fide Scala type, which we can abstract over via some type-class instance. This is also very useful for the writing of bi-functor interpreters, for users that are interested in this kind of UX. Output​ No surprise there: this is the data resulting from the run of the operation. StreamedInput, StreamedOutput​ Smithy supports the concept of Streaming. It is communicated as a trait that annotates a single field of the input shape or/and output shape of an operation. Scala does not have a &quot;standard&quot; way of expressing streaming semantics. Moreover, streaming constructs in Scala are heavily context dependant. It is therefore impossible for us to incorporate the concept of &quot;streaming&quot; to our Schema construct as it is meant to be context-free and third-party-free. To get some intuition for why that is: say we want to express streaming using fs2. If we naively generate a case class that has one of its fields annotated with @streaming, it means that the the field is of type fs2.Stream[F, A], which means that we either need to make a decision on what the F is, which is not okay for obvious reasons, or we need to propagate the F[_] type parameter upward to the case class. Now our Schema value, which accompanies the case-class, also have to carry the F ... this propagates throughout the whole codebase. We deemed that not acceptable. Rather than polluting all layers of abstraction, we decided to just have the concept of operation be impacted and hold the streamed type in a separate type parameter. This allows for interpreters from various ecosystem to emerge. It also has the quality of allowing users to access the unary component of outputs (ie, data that is communicated in the headers of HTTP responses) without necessarily allocating resources to consume the streamed component of the output. NB: at the time of writing this, Smithy4s does not have any streaming-aware interpreter implemented. But streaming is such a fundamental notion in remote interactions, and we had to devise a plan to ensure that third parties could decide to implement interpreters without waiting.

Additionally, each structure annotated with @error in smithy is rendered as a case-class that extends Throwable, because Throwables are the de-facto standard of doing error handling on the JVM. Even libraries that use Either to perform error handling often represent the left-hand-side of the Either as some throwable type, to facilitate the absorption of errors into the error-channels of monadic constructs (IO.raiseError, etc) As a result, it is important for Smithy4s to expose functions that generically enable the filtering of throwables against the Error type parameter of an operation, so that interpreters can intercept errors and apply the correct encoding (dictated via Schema) before communicating them back to the caller over the wire. Conversely, it is important to expose a function that allows to go from the generic Error type parameter to Throwable, so that errors received via low-level communication channels can be turned into Throwable at the client call site, in order to populate the relevant error channel when exposing mono-functor semantics. Therefore, when a smithy operation has errors defined, the corresponding smithy4s.Endpoint also extends the Errorable interface, which looks like this : trait Errorable[E] { def error: UnionSchema[E] def liftError(throwable: Throwable): Option[E] def unliftError(e: E): Throwable }  "},{"title":"Services and endpoints​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services and endpoints","url":"/smithy4s/docs/design/services#services-and-endpoints","content":"In order to implement any server-side interpreters, it is required to have a list of endpoints. That list is used to implement some matching logic based on the shapeId and/or the hints associated to the endpoints, in order to deterministically decide where to route a low level Request to a specific Endpoint instance. For instance, smithy provides a @http trait out of the box that can annotate operations : service KVStore { operations: [Get, Put] } @http(method: &quot;GET&quot;, uri: &quot;/resource/${key}, code: 200) operation Get { input: GetInput output: GetOutput } structure GetInput { @httpLabel key: String } structure GetOutput { value: String } @http(method: &quot;PUT&quot;, uri: &quot;/resource/${key}, code: 200) operation Put { } structure PutInput { @httpLabel key: String, @httpPayload value: String }  Each @http occurrence get translated to a scala value in the Hints associated to the corresponding endpoint. On server-side, having a list of all the endpoints associated to a service allows for creating a routing logic that dispatches an HTTP Request to the correct endpoint.On client-side, a method call to a service stub gets translated to an instance of the corresponding GADT member. From there, we have to retrieve the schemas associated to the member in question. Additionally, we need to extract the input value out of the member, to run it through an encoder derived from the the associated Schema.

First, let's define the service. $version: &quot;2&quot; namespace smithy4s.guides.auth use alloy#simpleRestJson @simpleRestJson @httpBearerAuth service HelloWorldAuthService { version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;, operations: [SayWorld, HealthCheck] errors: [NotAuthorizedError] }  Here we defined a service that has two operations, SayWorld and HealthCheck. We defined it such that any of these operations may return an NotAuthorizedError. Finally, we annotated the service with the @httpBearerAuth trait to indicate that the service supports authentication via a bearer token. If you are using a different authentication scheme, you can still follow this guide and adapt it for your needs. You can find a full list of smithy-provided schemes here. If none of the provided traits suit your use case, you can always create a custom trait too. Next, let's define our first operation, SayWorld: @readonly @http(method: &quot;GET&quot;, uri: &quot;/hello&quot;, code: 200) operation SayWorld { output: World } structure World { message: String = &quot;World !&quot; }  There is nothing authentication-specific defined with this operation, this means that the operation inherits the service-defined authentication scheme (httpBearerAuth in this case). Let's contrast this with the HealthCheck operation: @readonly @http(method: &quot;GET&quot;, uri: &quot;/health&quot;, code: 200) @auth([]) operation HealthCheck { output := { @required message: String } }  Notice that on this operation we have added the @auth([]) trait with an empty array. This means that there is no authentication required for this endpoint. In other words, although the service defines an authentication scheme of httpBearerAuth, that scheme will not apply to this endpoint. Finally, let's define the NotAuthorizedError that will be returned when an authentication token is missing or invalid. @error(&quot;client&quot;) @httpError(401) structure NotAuthorizedError { @required message: String }  There is nothing authentication specific about this error, this is a standard smithy http error that will have a 401 status code when returned. If you want to see the full smithy model we defined above, you can do so here. "},{"title":"Server-side Middleware​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Endpoint Specific Middleware","url":"/smithy4s/docs/guides/endpoint-middleware#server-side-middleware","content":"To see the full code example of what we walk through below, go here. We will create a server-side middleware that implements the authentication as defined in the smithy spec above. Let's start by creating a few classes that we will use in our middleware. AuthChecker​ case class ApiToken(value: String) trait AuthChecker { def isAuthorized(token: ApiToken): IO[Boolean] } object AuthChecker extends AuthChecker { def isAuthorized(token: ApiToken): IO[Boolean] = { IO.pure( token.value.nonEmpty ) // put your logic here, currently just makes sure the token is not empty } }  This is a simple class that we will use to check the validity of a given token. This will be more complex in your own service, but we are keeping it simple here since it is out of the scope of this article and implementations will vary widely depending on your specific application. The Inner Middleware Implementation​ This function is what is called once we have made sure that the middleware is applicable for a given endpoint. We will show in the next step how to tell if the middleware is applicable or not. For now though, we will just focus on what the middleware does once we know that it needs to be applied to a given endpoint. def middleware( authChecker: AuthChecker // 1 ): HttpApp[IO] =&gt; HttpApp[IO] = { inputApp =&gt; // 2 HttpApp[IO] { request =&gt; // 3 val maybeKey = request.headers // 4 .get[`Authorization`] .collect { case Authorization( Credentials.Token(AuthScheme.Bearer, value) ) =&gt; value } .map { ApiToken.apply } val isAuthorized = maybeKey .map { key =&gt; authChecker.isAuthorized(key) // 5 } .getOrElse(IO.pure(false)) isAuthorized.ifM( ifTrue = inputApp(request), // 6 ifFalse = IO.raiseError(new NotAuthorizedError(&quot;Not authorized!&quot;)) // 7 ) } }  Let's break down what we did above step by step. The step numbers below correspond to the comment numbers above. Pass an instance of AuthChecker that we can use to verify auth tokens are valid in this middlewareinputApp is the HttpApp[IO] that we are transforming in this middleware.Here we create a new HttpApp, the one that we will be returning from this function we are creating.Here we extract the value of the Authorization header, if it is present.If the header had a value, we now send that value into the AuthChecker to see if it is valid.If the token was found to be valid, we pass the request into the inputApp from step 2 in order to get a response.If the header was found to be invalid, we return the NotAuthorizedError that we defined in our smithy file above. ServerEndpointMiddleware.Simple​ Next, let's create our middleware by implementing the ServerEndpointMiddleware.Simple interface we discussed above. object AuthMiddleware { def apply( authChecker: AuthChecker // 1 ): ServerEndpointMiddleware[IO] = new ServerEndpointMiddleware.Simple[IO] { private val mid: HttpApp[IO] =&gt; HttpApp[IO] = middleware(authChecker) // 2 def prepareWithHints( serviceHints: Hints, endpointHints: Hints ): HttpApp[IO] =&gt; HttpApp[IO] = { serviceHints.get[smithy.api.HttpBearerAuth] match { // 3 case Some(_) =&gt; endpointHints.get[smithy.api.Auth] match { // 4 case Some(auths) if auths.value.isEmpty =&gt; identity // 5 case _ =&gt; mid // 6 } case None =&gt; identity } } } }  Pass in an instance of AuthChecker for the middleware to use. This is how the middleware will know if a given token is valid or not.This is the function that we defined in the step above.Check and see if the service at hand does in fact have the httpBearerAuth trait on it. If it doesn't, then we will not do our auth checks. If it does, then we will proceed.Here we are getting the @auth trait from the operation (endpoint in smithy4s lingo). We need to check for this trait because of step 5.Here we are checking that IF the auth trait is on this endpoint AND the auth trait contains an empty array THEN we are performing NO authentication checks. This is how we handle the @auth([]) trait that is present on the HealthCheck operation we defined above.IF the auth trait is NOT present on the operation, OR it is present AND it contains one or more authentication schemes, we apply the middleware. Using the Middleware​ From here, we can pass our middleware into our SimpleRestJsonBuilder as follows: object HelloWorldAuthImpl extends HelloWorldAuthService[IO] { def sayWorld(): IO[World] = World().pure[IO] def healthCheck(): IO[HealthCheckOutput] = HealthCheckOutput(&quot;Okay!&quot;).pure[IO] } val routes = SimpleRestJsonBuilder .routes(HelloWorldAuthImpl) .middleware(AuthMiddleware(AuthChecker)) .resource  And that's it. Now we have a middleware that will apply an authentication check on incoming requests whenever relevant, as defined in our smithy file.

In this part of the guide, we will show how you can do this for a client using the same smithy specification we defined above. We will make it so our authentication token is only sent if we are targeting an endpoint which requires it. ClientEndpointMiddleware.Simple​ The interface that we define for this middleware is going to look very similar to the one we defined above. This makes sense because this middleware is effectively the dual of the middleware above. object Middleware { private def middleware(bearerToken: String): Client[IO] =&gt; Client[IO] = { // 1 inputClient =&gt; Client[IO] { request =&gt; val newRequest = request.withHeaders( // 2 Authorization(Credentials.Token(AuthScheme.Bearer, bearerToken)) ) inputClient.run(newRequest) } } def apply(bearerToken: String): ClientEndpointMiddleware[IO] = // 3 new ClientEndpointMiddleware.Simple[IO] { private val mid = middleware(bearerToken) def prepareWithHints( serviceHints: Hints, endpointHints: Hints ): Client[IO] =&gt; Client[IO] = { serviceHints.get[smithy.api.HttpBearerAuth] match { case Some(_) =&gt; endpointHints.get[smithy.api.Auth] match { case Some(auths) if auths.value.isEmpty =&gt; identity case _ =&gt; mid } case None =&gt; identity } } } }  Here we are creating an inner middleware function, just like we did above. The only differences are that this time we are adding a value to the request instead of extracting one from it and we are operating on Client instead of HttpApp.Add the Authorization header to the request and pass it to the inputClient that we are transforming in this middleware.This function is actually the exact same as the function for the middleware we implemented above. The only differences are that this apply method accepts a bearerToken as a parameter and returns a function on Client instead of HttpApp. The provided bearerToken is what we will add into the Authorization header when applicable. SimpleRestJsonBuilder​ As above, we now just need to wire our middleware into our actual implementation. Here we are constructing a client and specifying the middleware we just defined. def apply(http4sClient: Client[IO]): Resource[IO, HelloWorldAuthService[IO]] = SimpleRestJsonBuilder(HelloWorldAuthService) .client(http4sClient) .uri(Uri.unsafeFromString(&quot;http://localhost:9000&quot;)) .middleware(Middleware(&quot;my-token&quot;)) // creating our middleware here .resource  "},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Endpoint Specific Middleware","url":"/smithy4s/docs/guides/endpoint-middleware#conclusion","content":"Once again, if you want to see the full code examples of the above, you can find them here.

This information is used automatically by downstream projects using Smithy4s, which automatically pulls additional jars that would be specified in this bit of metadata.

One side-effect of this is that if you produce JARs containing artifacts produced by Smithy4s code generation, they'll contain a smithy4s.tracking.smithy.

But in theory, the same generated code can be used conjointly with other serialisation technologies (protobuf for instance) and protocols (gRPC). Protocol specific &quot;hints&quot; (called traits)can be added to the smithy models. Smithy4s accurately renders corresponding values, and allows for their retrieval via the polymorphic interfaces. This is how HTTP semantics can be derived from the generated code, for instance. Smithy4s is also not tied to any third-party library, and users could provide integrations with existing libraries on their own side, or come up with new interesting usecases.

The header's value can be either the ShapeId of the error it is targeting OR the name without the namespace. The value of this header is case sensitive. Here are some examples of an X-Error-Type header: X-Error-Type: NotFoundError AND X-Error-Type: example.test#NotFoundError could each be used to map to the error type NotFoundError. This of course assumes that the NotFoundError is provided in either the service or operation errors array provided in the smithy model. All smithy4s services provide an X-Error-Type in responses by default. Status Code​ If the X-Error-Type header is not defined, smithy4s clients will use the status code to attempt to decide which error type to utilize. It does so as follows: If there is a single Error type that contains the correct status code in the httpError trait, this type will be used. If there are two error types with the same status code, an UnknownErrorResponse will be surfaced to the client.If there is NOT a matching status code, but there is a single error marked with the error trait, this error type will be used as long as the returned status code is in the range for either a client or server error. In other words if a single error shape has no status code, but is annotated with @error(&quot;client&quot;) and the returned status code is 404 then this error type will be used. If there are multiple error types with no status code and a matching error type (client/server), then an UnknownErrorResponse will be surfaced to the client. Here are some examples to show more what this looks like. Example smithy model: operation TestOp { ... errors: [NotFoundError, ServiceUnavailableError, CatchAllClientError, CatchAllServerError] } @httpError(404) @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure NotFoundError { message: String } @httpError(503) @error(&quot;server&quot;) structure ServiceUnavailableError { message: String } @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure CatchAllClientError { message String } @error(&quot;server&quot;) structure CatchAllServerError { message String }  And here are some scenarios using this example model. For all of these, assume that NO X-Error-Type header is provided. Status Code\tError Selected404\tNotFoundError 400\tCatchAllClientError 503\tServiceUnavailableError 500\tCatchAllServerError However, adding another error to the operation that looks like: @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure AnotherError { message: String }  Would result in the following: Status Code\tError Selected404\tNotFoundError 400\tUnknownErrorResponse 503\tServiceUnavailableError 500\tCatchAllServerError Notice that the 400 status code cannot be properly mapped. This is because there is no exact match AND there are two errors that are labeled with @error(&quot;client&quot;) which also do not have an associated httpError trait containing a status code. Adding another error type to the operation that looks like: @httpError(404) @error(&quot;client&quot;) structure AnotherNotFoundError { message: String }  Will result in the following: Status Code\tError Selected404\tUnknownErrorResponse 400\tUnknownErrorResponse 503\tServiceUnavailableError 500\tCatchAllServerError Now the 404 status code cannot be mapped. This is due to the fact that two different error types are annotated with a 404 httpError trait. This means that the smithy4s client is not able to decide which of these errors is correct.

As a convenience, Smithy4s provides mapErrors and flatMapErrors methods, that allow to intercept exceptions that were not specified in the spec, and transform them into exceptions that were. In particular, the smithy4s interpreters raise specific errors when they fail to decode http requests.

However, the actual interface is HelloServiceGen, which has a higher degree of polymorphism. It looks like this: package foo trait HelloServiceGen[P[_, _, _, _, _]]{ def greet(name: String): P[GreetInput, Greet.Error, GreetOutput, Nothing, Nothing] }  P represents an abstract context against which operations are going to run. The abstract context has 5 type parameters: inputerroroutputstreamed input (Nothing, most of the time)streamed output (Nothing, most of the time) Keeping track of these parameters is really important for the implementation intepreters. It also opens the door for providing interpreters that work against bi-functors (EitherT[IO, *, *]) without changing the generated code.
