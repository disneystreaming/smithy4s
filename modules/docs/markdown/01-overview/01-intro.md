[Smithy](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/) is an interface definition language (IDL) provided by AWS. It is protocol agnostic, flexible, and reasonably low surface, which facilitates the writing of tooling around it.

Smithy4s is a tool that generates third-party-free, protocol-agnostic scala code from smithy specifications.

Smithy4s can be used to:
* quickly derive http/rest servers and clients
* derive pure-scala AWS clients
* derive CLI tools
* and has the potential for much, much more!

Smithy4s supports both Smithy 2.0 and Smithy 1.0 models. You can read about the differences in [this blogpost](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/introducing-smithy-idl-2-0/) from AWS.
