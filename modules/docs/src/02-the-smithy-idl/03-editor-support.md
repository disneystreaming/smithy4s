Disney Streaming develops and maintains a [Smithy language server](https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy-language-server), that implements features such as jump-to-definition, auto-completion, validation diagnostics.

We also provide a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=disneystreaming.smithy) that talks to the language server, and provides a smooth developer experience.
