[Smithy](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/) is an interface definition language (IDL) provided by AWS. It is protocol agnostic, flexible, and reasonably low surface, which facilitates the writing of tooling around it.

smithy4s is a tool that generates third-party-free, protocol-agnostic scala code from smithy specifications.

Smithy4s can be used to:
* quickly derive http/rest servers and clients
* derive pure-scala AWS clients
* derive CLI tools
* and has the potential for much, much more!
