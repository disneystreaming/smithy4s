[Smithy](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/) is an interface definition language (IDL) provided by AWS. It is protocol agnostic, flexible, and reasonably low surface, which facilitates the writing of tooling around it.

smithy4s is a tool that generates third-party-free, protocol-agnostic scala code from smithy specifications.


Using this generated code in combination with some opt-in modules, you can use smithy4s

Smithy4s can be used to:
* quickly synthetise http/rest servers and clients
* synthetise pure-scala AWS clients
* synthetise CLI tools
* and has the potential for much, much more!
