/**
  * Generic representation of a service, as a list of "endpoints" (mapping to smithy operations).
  *
  * This abstraction lets us retrieve all information necessary to the generic implementation of
  * protocols, as well as transform implementations of finally-encoded interfaces into interpreters
  * (natural transformations) that operate on initially-encoded GADTs.
  *
  * @tparam Alg : a finally-encoded interface (commonly called algebra) that works
  *   against an abstract "effect" that takes 5 type parameters:
  *   Input, Error, Output, StreamedInput, StreamedOutput
  * @tparam Op : an initially encoded version of the finally-encoded interface. Typically,
  *   a GADT that acts as a reification of the operations. Passing the reified versions
  *   around makes it drastically easier to implement logic generically, without involving
  *   metaprogramming.
