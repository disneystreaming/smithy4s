/**
  * An abstraction that codifies the notion of modifying a message with some additional information.
  *
  * This has two input channels:
  *   * one for the message that is being modified (Message)
  *   * one for the actual data (A)
  *
  * This is particularly useful for http requests/responses, where different subsets of data
  * have a different impact on different locations of the http message : some fields may
  * impact headers, some fields may impact the http body, other things that are driven from
  * static information (smithy traits) may lead to a transformation of the message.
  *
  * Having the ability to decompose the notion of encoding a piece of data into different
  * writers that can be composed together is powerful and helps centralising some complexity
  * in third-party agnostic code.
  *
  * @tparam Message: some data being modified with the added information contained by A.
  * @tparam A: the type of data that is being written into the output channel
