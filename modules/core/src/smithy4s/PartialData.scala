/**
  * Data structure that can hold either the totality or a subset of a larger piece of data.
  *
  * This can be used to reconcile bits of data that are coming from several locations,
  * or to send a piece of data towards different locations.
  *
  * For instance :
  *
  * ```
  * structure AB {
  *   @httpPayload
  *   @required
  *   a: String,
  *
  *   @httpHeader("X-B")
  *   @required
  *   b: String
  * }
  * ```
  *
  * translates to this case class {{{ case class AB(a: String, b: String) }}}.
  *
  * However, codec derivation (performed by the SchemaVisitor mechanism in Smithy4s), does not let us easily solve for
  * problem such as http message decoding, because of the notion of priority : the http body of a message should not
  * be decoded if the metadata is not fully decoded first.
  *
  * In order to solve for this, the [[PartialData]] type allows to momentarily store a subset of the fields of a case
  * class so that it can be reconciled with other pieces of [[PartialData]] later on.
