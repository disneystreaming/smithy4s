# 0.17.5

This release is backward binary-compatible with the previous releases from the 0.17.x lineage.
However, the generated code produced by this version is not entirely source-compatible with the previous version.
More info below.

## Possible breaking changes

This version introduces changes in how the code is rendered that may result in some breakage in userland. We've
carefully architected the changes to reduce the likelihood of breakage happening.

A number of constructs are now rendered not in the companion object of the generated service, but rather in the companion
object of the reified operation type. These constructs include the error types that get generated by operations.

This change has been performed in order to eliminate the risk of collision between the generated types and some type
members present in the `smithy4s.Service` interface. This collision, when it happened, was making the code impossible to
compile.

In order to reduce breakage around the error types (which are likely to be used in userland), we have decided to generate
aliases at the location where they used to live. The generated code should not break source compatibility in the large
majority of usage of Smithy4s.

A small minority of users may have to change how they access the generated constructs they may have depended on. **This is unlikely**,
as the constructs in question are used internally by interpreters via interfaces that haven't changed, and they are not constructs
that are advertised in our documentation. We only expect some possible breakage in advanced usage performed by a handful of
people.

See:
* https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/859
* https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/848
* https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/847

## Behavioural changes

### Adjust encoding/decoding HTTP query parameters

Changed the handling of the `httpQueryParams` (plural) trait so that possible `httpQuery`-annotated fields do not take priority
over it **during decoding**. This means that `httpQueryParams` receive the whole set of query parameters, which may induce duplication
with the value contained by overlapping `httpQuery`-annotated fields.

On the encoding side, the behaviour is that `httpQuery` fields have priority over `httpQueryParams` fields.

This is a more faithful implementation of [the spec](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/http-bindings.html?highlight=httpquery#httpqueryparams-trait).

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/827


## Improvements

### Validate model for codegen after transformations

Adds logic to validate the model after pre-processing model transformations (before the code-generation)

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/821

### Support time zones in `DATE_TIME` parsing

AWS has changed the Smithy specification of the `DATE_TIME` timestamp format to precise that numeric offsets should be handled.
This is now the case.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/844

### Dynamic: Add `metadata` method

The currently undocumented `dynamic` module has received an improvement allowing to access the metadata
of the loaded models via its platform-agnostic interface.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/823


## Bug fixes

### Http4s client body

Empty bodies are now correctly using the built-in `withEmptyBody` of Http4s, which correctly removes
the `Content-Type` header from the request upon usage. This solves issues when Smithy4s is being called
(or calling) strict clients/servers that check this type of thing.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/826

### Handle NaN and Infinity in AWS JSON codecs

The AWS Json protocols specify that `NaN`, `Infinity` and `-Infinity` are valid values for `Double` and `Float` types.
This is now handled.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/822

### Better handling of special characters when loading Smithy models from dependencies

A bug was preventing dependencies that would have special characters in their absolute paths to be loaded successfully.
This is now fixed.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/850

### Http4s client: Support `Byte` parameters in paths

`Byte` fields are now correctly supported when used by an `httpLabel` member.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/819

# 0.17.4

This release is backward binary-compatible with the previous releases from the 0.17.x lineage.

## Improvements

### More efficient Json parsing of ArraySeq

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/806

### Fix parsing logic of AWS credentials file to allow for comments

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/811

### Add documentation on how to point AWS clients to local environments

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/812

# 0.17.3

This release is backward binary-compatible with the previous releases from the 0.17.x lineage.

## User-facing features

### Addition of an new `@adt` trait to streamline the inlining of structures as sealed-trait members

Under certain conditions, it is now possible to annotate union shapes with `@adt`, which has the effect of inlining
all the structure shapes under it directly in the companion object of the union, as opposed to create `Case`-suffixed
wrappers. Additionally, when a union is annotated with `@adt`, the intersection of mixin shapes that are applied to every member of the union is now used as Scala-level mixin traits. This facilitates object-oriented usage of Smithy4s.

Read the new docs for more info.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/787

### Scaladoc now gets generated

Smithy `@documentation` traits (which has syntactic sugar in the form of triple-slashes-prefixed comments) is now used to generate Scaladoc above the relevant data-types, interfaces and methods that get generated in Smithy4s.

https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/731

Thank you @zetashift for this awesome contribution and @msosnicki for this valuable contribution !

### Scala 3 wildcards now get generated when relevant.

Under conditions which should automatically be propagated from the build-tool to the code-generation,
Scala 3 wildcards now get generated instead of Scala 2 wildcards. This makes user experience better on
Scala 3, as syntax deprecation warnings will no longer be issued.

Thank you @albertpchen for this awesome contribution !

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/736

### Simpler AWS clients

It is now possible to directly instantiate AWS clients against a Monadic context, which makes for a better
UX when calling unary request/response operations. When using that mode, stream operations being called
such clients will fail with a raised exception.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/744

### AWS config file credentials providers

It is now possible to load credentials from an AWS-compliant configuration file (typically found under ~/.aws/credentials).
This is wired by default in the clients, and has lower precedence than the other providers.

### Improve docs

We've improved and added new sections to the documentation, in particular around AWS SDK usage and model pre-processing.
## Bug fixes

### Null default value traits are now correctly handled

The default trait allows for not setting a value. Now, the absence of value (ie null) in the
default trait at the smithy level translates to the correct "zero" value of the target type.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/782

### Decoding Document.DNull to Optional fields now works correctly

Null documents were not being decoded as `None`, but rather were leading to decoding failures
when decoding data types from `smithy4s.Document`

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/725

### Fix the JS source-map URI

The URI was previously using the wrong relative path

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/740

### Traits applied on collection members now leads to hints being correctly generated

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/769

### Defaults are not ignored in refinements

Loading a smithy 1.0 model with smithy 2.0 tooling (which Smithy4s uses) leads to the automatic
addition of "default" traits on some shapes and members. When combined with refinements, this had
the side effect of treating the refined type as required when it should be in fact optional.
It's all the more confusing that there is no mechanism in place to reconcile refinement logic,
with default values, as refinement logic is expressed in run-time code whereas default value validation
is expressed in build-time code.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/795

## Other notable changes

### Performance improvements of the json parsing logic

Yet another awesome contribution from @plokhotnyuk to shave allocations off the Json parsing logic, leading
to performance improvements.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/764

### Compliance tests

Our implementation of our `alloy#simpleRestJson` protocol is now derived automatically from test specifications
written in [Smithy itself](https://github.com/disneystreaming/alloy/tree/main/modules/protocol-tests/resources/META-INF/smithy)

See:
* https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/715
* https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/747

This also paves the road for testing our implementation of the AWS protocols using official tests, which are located
[there]

### Generic logic against smithy4s-generated enumerations is now easier to write

Some tweaks were made to the `smithy4s.Enumeration.Value` interface to allow for more generic logic using enumerations.

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/794

# 0.17.2

This release is backward binary-compatible with the previous releases from the 0.17.x lineage.

## User-facing features

### Scala 3 unions support for operation errors

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/707

In order to render Operation errors as Scala 3 union types, a following metadata flag needs to be added: `metadata smithy4sErrorsAsScala3Unions = true` (in any of the smithy files that are used for code generation).

### Source-mapping github paths are now automatically added during scala-js compilation

This will make it easier to run front-end debuggers on webpage build with smithy4s-issued clients

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/706

### Addition of Transformation.apply utilty method :

it's now possible to invoke transformations more conveniently in polymorhic code, via a method in the `Transformation` companion object

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/681

## Bug fixes

### Static query params are now handled correctly

It is now possible to define static query parameters when using the http trait :

```smithy
@http(method: "GET", uri: "/foo?bar=baz)
operation Foo {}
```

### Service interfaces now receive the set of all operations tied to resources transitively tied to the service

For instance, when running the code-generator, the `Library` interface will now receive a `getBook` method, which
wasn't previously the case

```smithy
service Library {
  resources: [Book]
}

resource Book {
  read: GetBook
}

@readonly
operation GetBook {
}
```

# 0.17.0

This 0.17.0 release of Smithy4s brings a number of improvements on the abstractions implemented by the generated code, in particular in terms of flexibility and user experience.

This release also aims at bringing inter-operability with other tools and projects that Disney Streaming is putting forward to reinforce the Smithy ecosystem, such as [smithy-translate](https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy-translate/) and [alloy](https://github.com/disneystreaming/alloy).

In order to achieve these improvements, we've had to break a number of things at different levels. This release is therefore neither source nor binary compatible with the previous ones, and also forces the user to update their Smithy specifications.

## Breaking changes

### Smithy-level breaking changes

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/561

The Smithy shapes that were previously residing under `smithy4s.api` namespace have moved to the `alloy` namespace. Alloy is a standalone library containing Smithy shapes and validators, defined [here](https://github.com/disneystreaming/alloy).

The reason for us to bring this change is to have a language specific location to define shapes that are relevant to the protocols/runtime-behaviours we're putting forward, that could be used by tooling working with other languages than Scala. It was important for us to lose the `4s` suffix, which is short for `for Scala`.

This change implies, for instance, that any use of `smithy4s.api#simpleRestJson` in your specification will have to be replaced by `alloy#simpleRestJson`.

Note that this change, in use cases that follow our documentation, should have no visible effect in the Scala code.

### Build-plugins breaking changes (SBT/mill)

#### Multiple input directories

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/587

The `smithy4sInputDir` setting/task in SBT/mill has been replaced by `smithy4sInputDirs`, allowing the user to set several directories where the plugins should look for Smithy files.

#### Change in smithy-library dependency resolution

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/607

We've changed the smithy-sharing mechanism to do two things:

1. By default, any dependency declared "normally" in SBT or mill, by means or `libraryDepedencies ++=` or `def ivyDeps`, will be inspected for Smithy files after being resolved. This means that, for instance, if your application has a runtime dependency on a library that was built with Smithy4s and contains Smithy files, your local specs can use the code defined in these Smithy files to create or annotate new shapes. You no longer need to declare those using `% Smithy4s` or `def smithy4sIvyDeps`: these are now reserved for libraries containing Smithy files that you **do not want your application's runtime to depend on**.
2. Libraries built by Smithy4s automatically track the dependencies that they used during their own code-generation, by storing some metadata in their Jar's manifests. By default, the Smithy4s plugins will also pull those dependencies (which will have been declared upstream using `% Smithy4s` in SBT or `def smithy4sIvyDeps` in mill), for your project's code generation. This facilitates the transitivity of specification-holding artifacts. This mechanism is used, for instance, to communicate to users projects the fact that Smithy4s depends on shapes that are defined in the [alloy](https://github.com/disneystreaming/alloy) library, and that these shapes should be made available to user projects, without impacting the user's application runtime, and without requiring any setup from the user.

### Normal-usage breaking changes in the generated code

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/599

Depending on your setup, it may be a breaking change, but `@deprecated` Smithy-traits now translate to the `@deprectated` Scala annotation in the generated code. For instance, if you used `@enum` heavily, you'll probably deprecation warnings in your console when compiling. Depending on your `scalacOptions`, it is possible that these warnings turn into errors. If you want to silence these particular errors while upgrading, you can do the following:

```sbt
scalacOptions ++= Seq(
  "-Wconf:msg=object Enum in package api is deprecated:silent",
  "-Wconf:msg=type Enum in package api is deprecated:silent",
  // for Scala 3
  "-Wconf:msg=object Enum in package smithy.api is deprecated:silent",
  "-Wconf:msg=type Enum in package smithy.api is deprecated:silent"
)
```

### Normal-usage source breaking changes

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/569

If you use Smithy4s in the ways that were previously advertised in the documentation, you may have to perform some small adjustments.

In particular, the `simpleRestJson` extension method that was added to implementations of service-interfaces generated by Smithy4s is now removed, in favour of the `SimpleRestJsonBuilder` construct (which now works for any `service` Smithy shape that will have been annotated with `alloy#simpleRestJson`).

Additionally, some methods that were deprecated in 0.16.x releases [have been removed](https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/589).

### Advanced usage breaking changes

The abstractions that the generated code implements and that the runtime interpreters use have undergone some massive changes.

Non-exhaustive list of symbol renames :

| old                               | new                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| smithy4s.Monadic                  | smithy4s.kinds.FunctorAlgebra     |
| smithy4s.Interpreter              | smithy4s.kinds.FunctorInterpreter |
| smithy4s.Service#asTransformation | toPolyFunction                    |
| smithy4s.Service#transform        | fromPolyFunction                  |
| smithy4s.PolyFunction             | smithy4s.kinds.PolyFunction       |
| smithy4s.Transformation           | smithy4s.kinds.PolyFunction5      |
| smithy4s.GenLift[F]#λ             | smithy4s.kinds.Kind1[F]#toKind5   |

#### Unification of the natural-transformations/polymorphic functions.

* Smithy4s makes a lot of use of polymorphic functions of various kinds. Those are now code-generated (see the `project/Boilerplate.scala` file) to ensure the consistency of the various ways they are being used. This means that `smithy4s.PolyFunction` has moved to `smithy4s.kinds.PolyFunction`, and that the previous `smithy4s.Transformation` is now `smithy4s.kinds.PolyFunction5`. This decision ripples in the `smithy4s.Service` interface, which now sports `toPolyFunction` and `fromPolyFunction` methods, allowing to turn a finally-encoded implementation into a final one. `smithy4s.kinds.PolyFunction2` is also a thing, and may be used in bi-functor contexts.
* `kind`-specific types were created to facilitate the "lift" of constructs to the right kinds. For instance, when inspecting the internals of this library, you might see things like `Kind1[IO]#toKind5` where it was previously `GenLift[IO]#λ`. We're hoping to convey meaning better, although this code is definitely still not trivial (and never will).
* `smithy4s.Transformation` is now a typeclass-like construct, which expresses the fact that a construct can be applied like a function. This construct is used by the `transform` method that is generated on service interfaces, which allows to apply custom behaviour generically on all method invocations in these interfaces.
* The `Service` interface takes a single `Alg` type parameter, the `Op` parameter has moved to type-member position, facilitating implicit search in some contexts (as well as the writing of some logic).
* A bunch of path-dependent type aliases were created in the `Service` interface.
* The `compliancetest` module has changed drastically in UX. For those not aware, this module allows to run tests written in Smithy against your own implementation of protocols. This will be useful for third-party libraries that implement `simpleRestJson` (or any other http/rest like protocol), to virtually get tests for free. We don't think this module had any users so far, but we'll slowly be porting some of our tests away from the `smithy4s` repository and into the `alloy` repository.

## User facing improvements

### Stubs

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/595

It is now possible to quickly stub a service with a default value (`IO.stub` being a good candidate), which can be helpful for testing purposes. The resulting code looks like this :

```scala
import smithy4s.hello._
import cats.effect._
val stubbedHelloWorld: HelloWorldService[IO] = new HelloWorldService.Default[IO](IO.stub)
```

### Transformations, including bi-functors

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/584

`smithy4s.Transformation`  has been revised to facilitate the integration with various shapes of transformations. It allows, in particular, to transform a service implementation by applying generic (but polymorphic) behaviour in all of its methods. For instance, this can be used to apply a timeout on all of the methods of a service, or retrying behaviour, etc ...

In particular, the `smithy4s.Transformation` companion object contains in particular `AbsorbError` and `SurfaceError` interfaces that developers can leverage to get their services to go from mono-functor (where all errors are treated as `Throwable`) to bi-functor (where errors are surfaced on a per-endpoint basis, forcing the developers to handle them one way or another), and vice-versa.

### Bi-functor-specialised type aliases

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/584/files#diff-064c6fb10e5927021c4fdb928e68fd8594443b767c54bec7d3b4a424e087401bR26

The generated code now contains bi-functor-specialised `ErrorAware`type-aliases. Those, combined with the transformations described above, should make it easier to interop with Bi-functor constructs such as `EitherT` or `ZIO`.

### Endpoint Specific Middleware

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/614

Adds the ability to have smithy4s-level middleware that is made aware of the `Server` and `Endpoint` for use in creating middleware implementations. This unlocks creating middleware that is aware of the Smithy traits (`Hints` in smithy4s) and shapes in your specification. This means the middleware can apply transformations based on traits applied in a Smithy specification and it can return error responses defined in the Smithy specification. An example of this is authentication. You are now able to create middleware that will check authentication on only the endpoints that require it AND you can return a smithy-defined error response when the authentication is not valid. See the [endpoint specific middleware guide](https://disneystreaming.github.io/smithy4s/docs/guides/endpoint-middleware) for more.


### Error Response Handling Improvements

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/570

Streamlines and improves how error responses are mapped to their corresponding smithy4s-generated types. It now works such that IF no `X-Error-Type` header is found AND the status code doesn't map precisely to an error annotated with `@httpCode` AND exactly one error happens to have `@error("client")` without `@httpCode`, that error will be selected (provided the status code is in the 4xx range). Same for `@error("server")` and 5xx range. See the [error handling documentation](https://disneystreaming.github.io/smithy4s/docs/protocols/simple-rest-json/client#error-handling) for more.

### Support for more HTTP methods

Previously, smithy4s's `HttpEndpoint` was limited to supporting just a small subset of HTTP methods (`POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE`). This is now mitigated, and all other methods are accepted by `HttpEndpoint`, by means of an open-enumeration.

### Configurable maximum arity during Json parsing

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/569

In order to mitigate known security problems, our json parsing logic has hard-limits over the number of elements it will parse from arrays
or maps, resulting in an error when receiving payloads with larger collections. Previously, this limit was hardcoded to 1024 elements per collection. This is now configurable, 1024 being the default.

### Polymorphic refinements

See https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy4s/pull/649

Refinements applied on list/map shapes can now produce parameterised types. This allows, for instance, to have generic
refinements on `list` shapes that produce `cats.data.NonEmptyList` containing the same types of elements.
